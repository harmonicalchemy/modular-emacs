* üìú History of Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs 
<<RDME>>

** üìÑ Introduction: 
<<RDME-introduction>>

This project has been a long time coming...  Its history dates back several years to a time in my life where I had become fed up with how commercial software holds your content hostage, /(especially word processors)/... I wanted to be able to publish to the web, but also other formats as well... And I did NOT wish to have more than one content source for those things... 

For years, as a software developer I used Emacs /(for coding, software design-development, and system administration on many platforms)/ I never had to change tools or content for that process as long as I could have or install Emacs on the platforms needed.

On the other hand, my management of human language documents was a nightmare in contrast! I switched many different word processors, MS Office, Open Office, Evernote, etc. etc. etc... All of this switching and migration from platform to platform caused me a LOT of tedious stressful work that should have been unnecessary to begin with!

All those years I never used Emacs Org-Mode and in fact did not even know about it in the early days...  I knew many Physics Professors where I worked at MIT who used Emacs/LaTeX to publish their work as professionally typeset documents... Back in those days I considered all that work to publish way OVERKILL.. but NOT Today... Not if you have worked out all the details and have Templates for all your publishing use cases...  Much LESS Overkill than all the wasted time I spent migrating and learning new word processor Apps in the past!!!

I never thought that Emacs would be the way I ended up writing and publishing after many painful "restarts" over the years switching from one word processing app to another on Macintosh, MS Windows, Linux, etc...

The day finally did came however to try out Emacs /(first using markdown mode, migrating from the Evernote App)/, but later scraping that idea, and going full HOG with org-mode...

In order to accomplish this, I needed to figure out better ways to configure my up-until-then BARE-BONES Emacs Configuration... /(after having used emacs mostly a code editor for over two decades)/...

My Journey started out by cloning a few Emacs repositories on Github and try different things out like that for a while.  I liked some things and tried to get rid of other things later.  Management became confusing after a while.  I ended up with lots of questionable elisp code, much of which were things possibly no longer needed!  

After a couple years of adding, removing, configuring, re-configuring, etc. it started feeling like I was painting myself into a tangled corner like getting lost in /"a maze of twisty little passages all alike!"/ Lets face it... I was not keeping good logs and my git management skills were wanting!  I was being: /"oh that looks cool lets try that"/ (cowgirl mode)... I got into a wee bit of trouble as a result of my wild adventures! It was all my fault! But it was fun just the same.

As a result of that saga, I learned a lot about ~SH~, ~BASH~, and ~ZSH~ best practices...  That spawned a complete re-write of my dotfiles project to become multiplatform and I now have a professional MULTIPLATFORM Authoring and Publishing System that produces Professionally Typeset Documents in pretty much any format...

** üìÑ Modular Emacs is Born: 
<<RDME-mod-emacs-is-born>>

In an attempt do things better and smarter, I decided to start over from scratch and make a modular system from the ground up with the primary purpose of preventing tangled messes like this from happening within current or future Emacs configurations!

=Modular Emacs= is more than just *Emacs* with configurable modules... It is also designed to be the centerpiece /(command central)/ of a larger personalized, extensible: *Dev‚ô∫Ops* / *Pub‚úéOps* workstation *IDE* capable of running on older but reasonably powerful laptops/desktops /(that would otherwise be considered legacy by most other standards)/.  

I am a systems architect, dev‚ô∫Ops engineer, computer scientist, composer/musician, sound designer, writer/publisher.  I wear a lot of hats! My Emacs needs to wear a lot of hats as well!  The central focus of *Modular Emacs* is to build empowering features into Emacs utilizing a modular framework that facilitates all the above without becoming an over complicated mess to manage! /"good luck with that"/  :octocat:

** üìÑ Why Modular? 
<<RDME-mod-why-modular>>

- *Purpose of Modular Emacs:* 

  *HarmonicAlchemy Productions* (HAP) *Modular Emacs* Was designed to be easy to maintain and configure through the management of independent modules... In that sense, Emacs hopefully forms a basic sensible framework that is easy to use and flexible enough to adjust to your work-style, programming-style, and writing-style... AND WON'T end up getting so bloated over time that you find yourself the victim of: *"Emacs Bankruptcy"* 

- *Only What You Need:* 

  You have choices encapsulated within modules. Each module comes with its own requirements.  Removing and or adding many of the extra feature modules will not disrupt the rest of your Emacs configuration. They have been designed to be encapsulated in that way... Some of the more basic modules are required for Modular Emacs basic operation however. The nice thing is everything is modular so it will be easy to find out which ones are doing what...

- *On the other hand:* 

  if you install Modular Emacs stripped of all external helper apps /(described below in the *Requirements* section)/, It may not provide any advantage over many of the other simpler Emacs projects on GitHub... Therefore if all you need is vanilla Emacs /(with some of the more basic options thrown in)/, you don't need Modular Emacs at all.

- *Other Emacs Config Options:* 

  [[https://github.com/hrs/sensible-defaults.el][Here is a simpler light weight "sensible" Emacs Config]] which claims to also be modular - I have not tried it. I only briefly read through the README. It looks like a good alternate option to try :octocat:

* üìÖ Change Log: 
** üìÖ 2025: 

=No Logs So far...= This feature is under evaluation for this HISTORY Doc... It may end up not being used as we already have a nice Current Status Doc that DOES contain an ongoing LOG where NEW And OLD detailed information about Modular Emacs can be found...

** üìÖ 2026:

/Not Here Yet but keep logging... The New Year will be here soon enough!/

- [[https://github.com/harmonicalchemy/Memacs][Memacs]] - /(fork of Karl Voit's Repo: harmonicalchemy@GitHub)/ 

  Memacs extracts metadata /(subjects, timestamps, contact information, etc.)/ from many different existing data sources /(file names, emails, tweets, bookmarks, etc.)/ on your computer and generates files which are readable by GNU Emacs with Org-Mode...

=ORG-TABLES:=

- [[https://www.teachmaths.org/20250117_orgmode-tables/][Exporting Org Mode Tables to LaTeX]] - /(teachmaths.org)/ 

  The tables produced by Org mode are pretty basic by default. However, you can use the LaTeX *tabularray* package to customise the look of your tables.

** üìÑ Introduction: 
<<META_intro>>

Use this Standard *README* /(template)/ as a multi purpose *README document* or a *Start Here First Document* for any kind of project...

=Such as for example:= A *Controlled Vocabulary* for your *TAGS* Which is something you will need to consult and make available to quickly consult while you are Writing things in Other Org-Mode Docs... Which WILL get published to different formats with the tags you chose for each document...

I stopped using Markdown files for this purpose a few years ago... This makes total sense as *Org-Mode* was designed exclusively for such things! *Markdown* is great for composing content intended for web pages etc.  But =Emacs Org Mode is Vastly Superior as BOTH a Project Management AND Publishing Environment=, with many features and power, completely agnostic of final publishing format... Whereas markdown mode excels doing one thing only... Translating author structured plain text into beautiful web pages... /(which is a good thing of course)/ 

I finally bit the long curve bullet and learned Emacs Org Mode /(after many many many years of using Emacs without it!)/ Today, looking back with current knowledge is like going back to a /"*Dec VT220* green screen *dumb terminal*"/ after experiencing *X Windows* on a Big *HP-UX Workstation!*

Yeah, that's a personal story from the past, lol... All you Mac users out there, please realize that your beautiful Apple desktop is in fact an *HP-UX Motif X-Windows widget set clone*!  That's what Steve Jobs believed to be the best X-Windows tool-kit of the day /(when he was building the NeXT computer)/...  So... Yup he copied that! The Applications Doc at the bottom of your screen is a dead giveaway. Hewlet Packard was first to use such UI concepts...

/(back before the dawning of the web we loved those HPUX Workstations! I got my first taste of them on the MIT Athena Project).../

*** Emacs Shorthand Command Key Notation: 
<<META_emacs-cmd-keys>> 

The command key conventions used in the instructions below, /(as well as all *Harmonic Alchemy Productions* docs)/, follow *Standard Emacs* command key naming conventions.

Official GNU Emacs documentation uses a shorthand notation to indicate the *Ctrl* key as an upper case *C-* (/with minus appended/). Upper case *M-* (/with minus appended/) is the shorthand notation for the Emacs *META* key...

If you are on Linux, BSD, or other machine there are OTHER Options on how to map your keys for the least stress on your fingers etc...  Now that I have an EXPENSIVE MacBook Pro I kind of gave up spending time building unix machines for office work... For me all my UNIX work is NOW only done on self hosted VPS running in data centers... (I got EMACS running on those configurations as well... and my Mac at home is my keyboard so NO Problems Messing with nx key mapping woes!

IF YOU NEED HELP on a LINUX box mapping your keys... /(lol GOOD LUCK)/... You can visit [[http://xahlee.info/kbd/linux_vs_windows_vs_mac_best_keybinding.html][Xah Lee's Linux vs Mac vs Windows Blog Post]] as well as: [[http://xahlee.info/kbd/keyboard_blog.html][Xah Lee's Keyboard Blog]] for great help with Keyboards to use /(focusing on Linux but urging you to use a Mac)/

*** Important Note For Mac Users: 
<<META_mac-users>> 

For the BEST experience using *HAP Modular Emacs* On MacOS, you need to install a Keyboard Mapping App called *Karabiner-Elements* [[https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/][LINK to Download]]

=THEN MAP YOUR KEYS as FOLLOWS:=

~CAPS-LOCK~ ‚ûî ~HOME~

     /(You WILL NEED THIS if you want to make your *xah-fly-keys* experience a FLYING one rather than a TRIPPING and CRASHING one)... LOL/ 

~F6~ ‚ûî ~CAPS-LOCK~ 

     /(You don't really need to use this much as there is another key "~\~" assigned via *xah-fly-keys* that can do some fancy upper/lower case flipping of words, paragraphs, etc... Try it... you will see %^)/

In addition *xah-fly-keys* makes the following Emacs Configurations:
     
=Control Key:=    ~C-~ ‚ûî ~‚åò~ /(Apple Command Key)/

=META Key:=           ~M-~ ‚ûî ~‚å•~ /(Apple Option key)/

=Apple Ctrl Key:= ~‚åÉ~ ‚ûî Still Works as standard Control Key /(emacs, other apps, console, etc.)/

=ALSO:= For ALL machines using *xah-fly-keys* config, typing the "~a~" key invokes the Emacs ~M-x~ Key Chord directly... allowing you to immediately type and execute an emacs command from a single key alone right under your left little finger!

With *Karabiner-Elements* [[https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/][LINK to Download]] Installed and configured properly as above, AND you are using *HAP Modular Emacs* configured to use *XAH-FLY-KEYS*, =Keep the Following in Mind:=

While following instructions from standard vanilla Emacs docs, NOTE that your ~Ctrl~ , ~META~ and ~CAPS-LOCK~ keys are not /"standard"/ anymore and you must make a mental translation to the keys you have reassigned... /(you will get used to it soon enough)/ It has been designed /(after YEARS of research by Xah Lee)/ to Protect your fingers and fine motor muscles...

Beyond that, you will be fine following other emacs tutorials etc.  Hey... you Mac enthusiasts are used to that kind of /"being different"/ stuff anyway, right? Being one of /"the rest of us"/ that is... What the heck does that mean anyway? LOL

The above key assignments were done to get the *Emacs C-* key closer to the space bar where it can be activated with your left thumb instead of contorting to get at it with your pinkie finger. This makes using *Xah Fly Keys* even easier to use and less stressful on your fingers...

In the Official Emacs documentation you will commonly find key command notations such as *C-x* or *M-x*... This means: Hold the *Ctrl* /(or *META*)/ key down while typing the *x* key.  

Any time you see this notation, regardless of what key may be connected to it with a dash /(e.g., *C-c*, *M-5*, etc.)/, this means to hold the *Ctrl*-or-*META* key down while you press the other key connected to it with the dash... If you have a command that includes many *C-key* or *M-key* commands in succession simply hold the *Ctrl*-or-*META* key down the entire time you type the other keys and then let go...

If you see other keys alone separated by a space after the *C-x* or *M-x* /(e.g., C-x *d*, M-x *b*, etc.)/ this means to type that key /AFTER/ letting go of the *Ctrl*-or-*META* key...

*Got that?* That's the key notation system we use here... It is all standard Emacs...  The above paragraphs are mostly for the benefit of new Emacs users! And there is more to learn below. If you are an Emacs/Org-Mode veteran please bear with us...

For *HELP* using *Xah-Fly-Keys* with *HAP Modular Emacs* [[][VISIT THIS DOC] ] =TBD= later...

*** Org Mode Timestamps and Clocking: 
<<META_time-clocking>> 

This Template utilizes the default *Org-Mode:* "~C-c .~" Command. /(i.e., That's Ctrl-c and then type a dot. This Enters a timestamp range at the cursor position)/. The command employs *org-evaluate-time-range* to compute time on task.  This is useful for Time Sheets etc. 

In addition, the *Log Entry (template)* stores and tracks *Org-Mode* ~:CLOCKING:~ entries and displays results in a *Time Card Table* with total time computed... 

Common time clocking commands are defined within the *Log Entry* /(template)/ itself...

Any time you need to look up clocking commands, open the ~:README:~ drawer under the *Log Entry* /(template)/ heading by placing your cursor over it and hitting ~TAB~...

** ‚ùî How To: 
<<META_howto>>

=NOTE:= Additional HELP/Commands for using *Org-Mode* with Modular Emacs will be explained here if needed, as well as other *Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs Templates* that get produced in the future...

*** Create A New Log Entry: [0/1] 
<<META-HOWTO_create-new-log-entry>>

- [ ] *RESET all Check Boxes UNDER These Headings:* 

  Do this FIRST before following any of the tasks... This is to help you get your workflow down...

  Later once you got all this in muscle memory you can forget wasting your time here...

  /(this is for beginners - HOPE IT HELPS)/

**** Copy/Clone: *üóì Generic Log Entry:* [0/2] 
/(BOILERPLATE Log Entry from *‚éò Templates* Binder)/ 

- [ ] *SELECT the ENTIRE NEW LOG /(heading)/ & ALL its Contents:* 

  Use normal Emacs selection methods. i.e., Type ~t~ key to set the mark for selection, /(xah-fly-keys Command/ /Mode)/ or use ~C-SPACE~ /(normal Emacs)/, and move the point to get the entire heading, and all of its contents, but NOTHING else... =and copy it...=

  =Note:= Before Copying Selected Text, ensure your cursor is at the end of it BUT not be part of any items after it... Placing your cursor on the first column of the next line will include the invisible new-line character which is what you want, but any text directly under the cursor on the next line will not be copied...  Later, after pasting this text somewhere else, your cursor will end up sitting on the first column of a blank line under the pasted text. /(exactly as intended)/

*** HAP Org Mode Anchors: [0/5] 
**** HAP ANCHORS HOWTO: [0/3] 
<<META-HOWTO_hap-ancs>>

Here are some *GUIDELINES for Creating and Editing ANCHORS* as well as *LINKS* to them within any ~HAP_Doc-Skeleton.org~ Template file...

- [ ] *Adjust ANCHORS to make them UNIQUE:* 

  Anchors Must Be Unique! Following HAP ANCHOR CONVENTIONS helps this process transparently... Be Extra Careful if you make any ANCHORS into RADIO TARGETS!

  =NOTE:= All of this work in the beginning will help keep your anchors unique within this file, and also add an extra *KM* dimension of *category* to them automagically...

  Your unique anchors may be used to link to sections or headings from other sections within this file, and quite easily reach the headings or sections from EXTERNAL *Org-Links* referencing the FILE simply by adding the ANCHOR name after the Path/File Spec separated by two colons /(i.e., ~::~ )/...

  To reach these ANCHORS from an external file: *Use xfk Command:* ~O~ /(UPPER CASE Letter: O while in xfk COMMAND Mode)/... That will OPEN the Target Org file in a NEW Frame Without Closing your Current Frame or Loosing your Current Org File Position...

  It would be wise to follow this convention when you create anchors elsewhere within ALL of your Writing Projects created from HAP Modular Emacs Document Skeleton Template files...

  If you wish to change any of this, go ahead and do what ever you want... For simplicity's sake, follow the instructions below... There are ways to use *:PROPERTY:* directives to get your links GLOBAL as well... I prefer to do it manually... The alternate is a mess IMHO... I don't have time to spend on this mess... What I have currently works nice and simple for me... Probably you too... /(trust me I have tried EVERYTHING - Well... ALMOST)/ lol

- *ANCHORS within the the üìã Meta: binder are ALL SET:* 

  You don't need to change ANY of the ANCHORS within the the *üìã Meta:* binder... These anchors are all fixed...

  =You may= Place an *org-link* to any of the ~ANCHORS~ contained within the *üìã Meta:* binder from elsewhere within CLONES of ANY of these ~HAP_Doc-Skeleton.org~ Template files and it will work... You might find making links to sections of the *üìã Meta:* binder useful as a quick reference while you are writing, easy access from the place where you are writing...

- [ ] *Radio Targets:* 

  There is ALSO a neat *org-mode trick* called *Radio Targets* 

  If you want to use that, simply place another pair of angle brackets ~< >~ around ANY of the ANCHORS within CLONES of these ~HAP_Doc-Skeleton.org~ template files.

  Doing that will make the *NAME* inside the ANCHOR into a *HOT NAME* that will instantly =Turn Into a LINK= ANY TIME you type the *NAME* somewhere within the file!

  =NOTE:= Radio Targets are NOT GLOBAL... /(i.e, they only work within the .org file they were created in)/ You cannot address these ANCHORS alone from an external file...

  =In other words, don't worry=... If you visit another org file and accidentally type a radio anchor name from ANOTHER file, nothing will happen and you will not be disrupted... the radio anchor from the remote file will NOT activate within your current file... Even if it did, It would not work since ANCHORS themselves are Not GLOBAL..

  =NOTE:= You have to INITIALIZE any radio anchors you create for the first time with the command: ~C-c~ ~C-c~ before they will automagically turn into links... =HOWEVER=, These NEW Radio Anchors WILL get initialized automatically once you close and re-open the file...

- [ ] *Existing ANCHORS and LINKS within ~HAP_Doc-Skeleton.org~ Template files:* 

  SOME ANCHORS already have LINKS going to them within *LOG Templates*... These LINKS are present in the *Sub-Headings* under the *‚úÖ Summary* AND *üìí Details* Headings...  Use ~SPACE-BAR b~ /(xfk shortcut key command)/ to expand links so you can see them under these sub-headings and change them to MATCH the Changed ANCHORS that they should be linking to... 

**** HAP Org-Mode ANCHOR Conventions: 
<<META-HOWTO_hap-anc-cnvents>>

The following is a *UNIQUE Mnemonic ANCHOR Convention* which is standard across ALL ~HAP_Doc-Skeleton.org~ Template files...

Use this Convention to create, adjust, and use  ~<ANCHORS>~ under *Org Headings* within your CLONED ~HAP_Doc-Skeleton.org~ files...

=For me= this is a *quite easy scheme to use*, especially once I got used to using it... It becomes a simple extra step to take anytime I create a heading that I believe is one that needs to be referenced a LOT... Done instantly... Easy... 

*Here is how it Works:*

- *HAP ANCHORS* comprise =THREE= ~mnemonic~ =SYMBOLS= 

  Three symbols separated by an underscore ~_~ character... 

  The =first= mnemonic is the ~PREFIX~ 

  The =second= mnemonic is the ~LABEL~ 

  The =third= mnemonic is the ~postfix~ 

- The ~PREFIX~ 

  The PREFIX is there to identify the *KIND of file* or *Major Section Within* that File where the *ANCHOR* has been placed...

- The ~_LABEL_~ 

  The LABEL is a short UPPER CASE mnemonic representing the =Title= of the *PARENT Heading* above it. Be careful NOT to make this so cryptic and short that you no longer recognize the original Title it represents...  /(just as in creating variable or parameter names in programs)/

- The ~postfix~ 

  The postfix is a short lower case mnemonic representing the =Title= of the *Heading* =Directly Above= the *ANCHOR* that represents it.

***** Putting It All Together: 

*Here are some Examples of how these Three mnemonics are Used Together:*

- For *MAIN HEADINGS* it looks like this: ~PREFIX_postfix~ 

  =NOTE:= There is no ~LABEL~ in Main Heading ANCHORS... In fact... ONLY the PREFIX alone is used for ANCHORS that reflect *Main Headings* of *Major Sections* within any ~HAP_Doc-Skeleton.org~ files...

- For *SUB HEADINGS* it looks like this: ~PREFIX_LABEL_postfix~ 

  LABEL appears here representing the =Title= of the Sub-Heading's *PARENT Heading*

- For *SUB-SUB HEADINGS* it might look like this: ~PREFIX_LABEL_LABEL_postfix~ 

  /(etc...and probably unnecessary overkill as well - but if you need an anchor like this, This is how you go about expanding the ANCHORS to reflect the extension of the schema above it - like a path)/

  =NOTE:= To make the Idea Above =More Practical=... You may OFTEN create *Sub Headings* within your doc that by themselves do not contain any TEXT, figures, tables, or other objects  between them and their children *Sub-Sub Headings*... =INSTEAD=, they may have many *sub-sub headings* under them which are all specifics of the *Sub-Heading category*...

  =In That Case= you would not put an anchor under the *Main Sub-Heading* but rather place ANCHORS under =ALL= the *Sub-Sub Headings* Instead... These *sub-sub* ANCHORS would Not have as many LABEL Chains, /(e.g., ~_LABEL_LABEL_LABEL_~ )/ in them... Using that idea makes it =LESS Over Kill= AND *You Will Need to LINK* to those *specific headings* that have good content directly under them rather than a family of *child headings* which you would then have to choose from manually...

<<LOG_generic-entry>>
=LOG-DATE:= <2021-03-29 Mon>  
:HOW-TO-USE-THIS: 

=COMMANDEERING CLONES of this GENERIC LOG Entry BOILERPLATE TEMPLATE:=

- [ ] *COMMANDEER Your New CLONE:* 

  The structure of this GENERIC LOG Entry Template's content layout is all set up for you ahead of time to allow you to immediately begin writing... /(You only need to change titles etc...)/ 

  After cloning, =RENAME= *üóì Generic LOG Entry* /(BOILERPLATE Log Entry TEMPLATE)/ to a *Unique Title* in order to commandeer this log entry item for your own needs... 

  =Do NOT PUT "LOG" in your Title!= /(not needed as you already placed this clone within your log binder)/

- [ ] *UPDATE =LOG-DATE= ~<timestamp>~ to TODAY:* 

  Place your cursor directly on the existing =LOG-DATE:= ~<timestamp>~ directly under the title of THIS CLONED or REPURPOSED *üóì Generic LOG Entry:* and enter the key binding: ~C-c .~ /(i.e., press/ ~Ctrl~ /key while holding/ ~c~ /and then type a dot ~.~ /)/ A date chooser panel will pop up... 

- [ ] *Type One More DOT:* 

  Type one more dot ~.~ to force the calendar selection to the current time and date and then, Press ~ENTER~ to accept your choice... /This will update the existing BOILERPLATE timestamp with TODAY's date/time.../ 

  Check to make sure the timestamp was properly updated then move on to the next step...

  This timestamp will =NOT BE UPDATED AFTER THIS=... This timestamp records the FIRST time you started this particular Log entry... You need that date to stay permanent for historical reasons... 

  =NOTE:= /This is the FIRST Time Tracking TASK of Starting a NEW LOG Entry/...

  =DO NOT CHANGE the TITLES of These MAIN Headings:= *üìö Reference* , *‚è∞ Time Card* , *‚úÖ Summary* , or *üìí Details* =Within your CLONES=... 

  =BUT= YOU Will Need to =CHANGE PART of the ANCHOR LINKS= under these main headings...

=NOTE:= You will need to change all these default ANCHORS and LINKS in the beginning before you start using the log entry, /(e.g., Making SURE CASE shifting of parent heading mnemonics are done correctly, etc...)/ You should have read [[META-HOWTO_hap-anc-cnvents][HAP ANCHOR CONVENTIONS]] /(above)/ under the *‚ùî How To:* binder to help you get started...

=However=, Soon enough... you will have figured out the pattern and it will become second nature for your workflow the next time you clone one of these things... /(I hope)/ Follow the steps below to adjust ANCHORS within CLONES of this *üóì Generic LOG Entry:* 

- [ ] *Change The üóì Log Entry MAIN ANCHOR:* /<LOG_generic-entry>/ 

  =USE the Above:= [[META-HOWTO_hap-ancs][HAP ANCHORS HOWTO]] and *HAP Org-Mode* [[META-HOWTO_hap-anc-cnvents][ANCHOR CONVENTIONS]] to Change the MAIN ANCHOR directly under the *LOG Entry's Main Title* /(heading)/ to match your NEW *LOG Entry's Title*... /(your new renamed log TITLE is actually the ~postfix~ and there is NO ~_LABEL_~ within this Anchor as it is under a MAIN Heading)/ 

  Change ~generic-entry~ /(the postfix)/ to a short but unique abbreviation, acronym, or mnemonic of your NEW Log Entry's *Title*... /(don't make it too cryptic to the point that you can no longer cognitively connect your mnemonic with the actual title)/ but keep it short and simple as possible.  In case you have to make anchors more than 3 levels deep this practice will keep your anchors short, /(as you will find out)/

  You may LINK to this Unique ANCHOR from other sections of this Log... You may also link to this Anchor from external ORG-LINKS that reference this File in the first part of the link adding this ANCHOR separated by a double colon, /(i.e. ~::~ )/

- [ ] *Change the üìö Reference: ANCHOR:* /<LOG_GENERIC-ENTRY_ref>/ 

  =USE the Above:= [[META-HOWTO_hap-ancs][HAP ANCHORS HOWTO]] and *HAP Org-Mode* [[META-HOWTO_hap-anc-cnvents][ANCHOR CONVENTIONS]] to Change the *üìö Reference:* ANCHOR... 

  For the *üìö Reference:* ANCHOR, Leave the ~PREFIX~ and ~postfix~ alone but CHANGE the ~_LABEL_~ portion of the Anchor...

  COPY the lower-case ~postfix~ portion from the ANCHOR under your CLONED/RENAMED version of This: *üóì Generic LOG Entry:* /(which is now a mnemonic representing your New Log Entry Title)/ and use that to rename ~GENERIC-ENTRY~ within the *üìö Reference:* ANCHOR... *THEN CHANGE it to UPPER CASE* to comply with HAP Org-Mode ANCHOR Conventions.  This mnemonic has NOW transformed into this ANCHOR's ~_LABEL_~

  As explained within: [[META-HOWTO_hap-anc-cnvents][ANCHOR CONVENTIONS]] /(see, you know what the mnemonics in that link mean right?)/, The new ~_LABEL_~ is simply the UPPER CASE version of the ~postfix~ within the ANCHOR under its *PARENT heading*...

  You may LINK to this Unique ANCHOR from other sections of this Log... You may also link to this Anchor from external ORG-LINKS that reference this File in the first part of the link adding this ANCHOR separated by a double colon, /(i.e. ~::~ )/ =However:= This Reference section may also be duplicated within those files as well which you will be able to LINK directly to by using this same ANCHOR alone... But maybe the reference section within this LOG contains some good things needed for your work elsewhere... You will find out soon enough how to organize things to make your workflow easier... /(I have no idea... It's not my workflow... It's your workflow)/...

  =NOTE:= For All *Sub-Headings* the ~_LABEL_~ is actually the UPPER CASE version of the *Parent Heading's* ~posfix~ /(i.e., a mnemonic of the parent heading's title)/

  *Leave the* ~_postfix~ *Portion ALONE* because the Reference Heading does not change...

- [ ] *Change the *‚è∞ Time Card: ANCHOR:* /<LOG_GENERIC-ENTRY_time-card>/ 

  =USE the Above:= [[META-HOWTO_hap-ancs][HAP ANCHORS HOWTO]] and *HAP Org-Mode* [[META-HOWTO_hap-anc-cnvents][ANCHOR CONVENTIONS]] to Change *‚è∞ Time Card:* ANCHOR...

  For the *‚è∞ Time Card:* Anchor, Leave the ~PREFIX~ and ~postfix~ alone but CHANGE the ~_LABEL_~ portion of the Anchor...

  COPY your lower-case ~postfix~ portion from the ANCHOR under your CLONED/RENAMED version of This: *üóì Generic LOG Entry:* /(which is now a mnemonic representing your New Log Entry Title)/ and use that to rename ~GENERIC-ENTRY~ within the *‚è∞ Time Card:* Anchor... CHANGE it to UPPER CASE to comply with HAP Org-Mode ANCHOR Conventions.  This mnemonic has NOW transformed into this ANCHOR's ~_LABEL_~

  The new ~_LABEL_~ is simply the UPPER CASE version of the ~postfix~ within the ANCHOR under its *PARENT heading*...

  You may LINK to this Unique ANCHOR from other sections of this Log... You may also link to this Anchor from external ORG-LINKS that reference this File in the first part of the link adding this ANCHOR separated by a double colon, /(i.e. ~::~ )/

  *Leave the* ~_postfix~ *Portion ALONE* because the Time Card Heading does not change...

- [ ] *Change the *‚úÖ Summary: ANCHOR:* /<LOG_GENERIC-ENTRY_summary>/ 

  =USE the Above:= [[META-HOWTO_hap-ancs][HAP ANCHORS HOWTO]] and *HAP Org-Mode* [[META-HOWTO_hap-anc-cnvents][ANCHOR CONVENTIONS]] to change the *‚úÖ Summary:* ANCHOR...

  For the *‚úÖ Summary:* Anchor, Leave the ~PREFIX~ and ~postfix~ alone but CHANGE the ~_LABEL_~ portion of the Anchor...

  COPY your lower-case ~postfix~ portion from the ANCHOR under your CLONED/RENAMED version of This: *üóì Generic LOG Entry:* /(which is now a mnemonic representing your New Log Entry Title)/ and use that to rename ~GENERIC-ENTRY~ within the *‚è∞ Time Card:* Anchor... CHANGE it to UPPER CASE to comply with HAP Org-Mode ANCHOR Conventions.  This mnemonic has NOW transformed into this ANCHOR's ~_LABEL_~

  The new ~_LABEL_~ is simply the UPPER CASE version of the ~postfix~ within the ANCHOR under its *PARENT Heading*... 

  You may =LINK to this Unique ANCHOR= from other sections of this Log... You may also link to this Anchor from =External Org-Links= that =Reference This File= in the =First Part= of the link adding this ANCHOR to the end of the file spec separated by a double colon, /(i.e. ~::~ )/ Org ANCHORS,  just as in HTML are =LOCAL FILE LINKS= appended to the URL to get the cursor exactly to the subject of interest within the target File or HTML page...

  *Leave the* ~_postfix~ *Portion ALONE* because the *‚úÖ Summary:* Heading does not change...

  =NOTE:= *SUB-HEADINGS* under the *‚úÖ Summary:* ANCHOR ALSO Contain ANCHORS that you will =Need To Change=, as well as the LINKS to those ANCHORS from the *üìí Details:* section that you will =ALSO Need To Change=...

  Use ~SPACE-BAR b~ /(xfk shortcut key command)/ to =expand links= so you can see them under these *sub-headings* and change them to =MATCH the Changed ANCHORS= they should be linking to...

  =NOTE:= After Initial CLONING, /(i.e., While Executing This HOW-TO-USE-THIS TASK)/ You will ONLY need to change the ~_LABEL_~ portion: ~GENERIC-ENTRY~ of all of these anchors to your NEW Log Entry Title mnemonic, to fix the anchors... /(For now... until such time that you need to RENAME these ITEMS Later)/ when you actually start writing in this LOG... Then you will need to change the ~postfix~ mnemonic to match your changed sub-heading titles as well...

  =ALSO NOTE:= If you DO NOT change the ~_LABEL_~ portion: ~GENERIC-ENTRY~ of all of these anchors within your CLONE /(Right NOW)/ you will BREAK org-links within this file when you try to use them, because =you just duplicated a BUNCH of Anchors= within the *üìã Meta:* Binder!! The ~_LABEL_~ portion MUST change but the ~postfix~ mnemonics can STAY... Your new ANCHORS will be Unique...

- [ ] *Change the üìí Details: ANCHOR:* /<<LOG_GENERIC-ENTRY_details>>/ 

  =USE the Above:= [[META-HOWTO_hap-ancs][HAP ANCHORS HOWTO]] and *HAP Org-Mode* [[META-HOWTO_hap-anc-cnvents][ANCHOR CONVENTIONS]] to change the *üìí Details:* ANCHOR...

  For the *üìí Details:* Anchor, Leave the ~PREFIX~ and ~postfix~ alone but CHANGE the ~_LABEL_~ portion of the Anchor...

  COPY your lower-case ~postfix~ portion from the ANCHOR under your CLONED/RENAMED version of This: *üóì Generic LOG Entry:* /(which is now a mnemonic representing your New Log Entry Title)/ and use that to rename ~GENERIC-ENTRY~ within the *üìí Details:* Anchor... CHANGE it to UPPER CASE to comply with HAP Org-Mode ANCHOR Conventions.  This mnemonic has NOW transformed into this ANCHOR's ~_LABEL_~

  The new ~_LABEL_~ is simply the UPPER CASE version of the ~postfix~ within the ANCHOR under its *PARENT Heading*...

  You may =LINK to this Unique ANCHOR= from other sections of this Log... You may also link to this Anchor from =External Org-Links= that =Reference This File= in the =First Part= of the link adding this ANCHOR to the end of the file spec separated by a double colon, /(i.e. ~::~ )/ Org ANCHORS,  just as in HTML are =LOCAL FILE LINKS= appended to the URL to get the cursor exactly to the subject of interest within the target File or HTML page...

  *Leave the* ~_postfix~ *Portion ALONE* because the *üìí Details:* Heading does not change...

  =NOTE:= *SUB-HEADINGS* under the *üìí Details:* Heading ALSO Contain ANCHORS that you will =Need To Change=, as well as the LINKS to those ANCHORS from the the *‚úÖ Summary:* section that you probably already changed above if you are following these steps in sequence...

  Use ~SPACE-BAR b~ /(xfk shortcut key command)/ to =expand links= so you can see them under these *sub-headings* and change them to =MATCH the Changed ANCHORS= they should be linking to...

  =NOTE:= After Initial CLONING, /(i.e., While Executing This HOW-TO-USE-THIS TASK)/ You will ONLY need to change the ~_LABEL_~ portion: ~GENERIC-ENTRY~ of all of these anchors to your *NEW Log Entry Title* mnemonic, to fix the anchors... /(For now... until such time that you need to RENAME these ITEMS Later)/ when you actually start writing in this LOG... Then you will need to change the ~postfix~ mnemonic to match your changed sub-heading titles as well...

  =ALSO NOTE:= If you DO NOT change the ~_LABEL_~ portion: ~GENERIC-ENTRY~ of all of these anchors within your CLONE /(Right NOW)/ you will BREAK org-links within this file when you try to use them, because =you just duplicated a BUNCH of Anchors= within the *üìã Meta:* Binder!! The ~_LABEL_~ portion MUST change but the ~postfix~ mnemonics can STAY... Your new ANCHORS will be Unique...

- [ ] *Change ANCHORS of Sub Headings:* /<<PREFIX_PARENT-HEADING_postfix>>/ 

  =USE the Above:= [[META-HOWTO_hap-ancs][HAP ANCHORS HOWTO]] and *HAP Org-Mode* [[META-HOWTO_hap-anc-cnvents][ANCHOR CONVENTIONS]] to Create and/or Change ANCHOR's Under *Sub Headings* & *Sub-Sub Headings*...

  =FOR ALL EXISTING= *Sub Headings* under the *üìí Details:* heading... For NOW... You will need ONLY to CHANGE the ~_LABEL_~ portion of the ANCHORS... As explained in the two bullets above this one... Later when you actually start logging within this log, you will be changing the ~postfix~ as well... /(within LINKS & ANCHORS)/

  FOR *New Sub-Headings* /(ANYWHERE not just this Log Entry)/ First... Copy an existing Sub-Heading /(a sibling of the place where you want to make a new sub-heading)/ and modify that ANCHOR in the same way as above... /(easy-peasy)/

  If you decide to Create a *New Sub-Heading* =FROM SCRATCH= or suddenly find you have no siblings to CLONE, *Make your NEW ANCHOR look like the following:* /(not so easy-paasy)/

  ~PREFIX_LABEL_postfix~ where ~PREFIX~ is pretty much the same for all the ANCHORS of the MAJOR Section you are in, ~LABEL~ is the title of the *Parent Heading*, and ~postfix~ is the title of this new *sub-heading*... /(all mnemonics)/ That's It in a nutshell... *Now do it below*...

  *COPY:* The lower-case ~postfix~ mnemonic from the ANCHOR under the *Parent Heading* of your New *Sub-Heading* and place that AFTER the ~PREFIX~ of your *NEW Sub Heading* ANCHOR separated by an underscore character... This NOW represents the LABEL of your new Sub-Heading Anchor so you must also *change it to UPPER-CASE* now...

  Create a ~_postfix~ mnemonic representing your *NEW Sub Heading* title and place that after the ~_LABEL~ mnemonic separated by an underscore character... That's it... All done...

**** NEW ‚è∞ Time Card: 
<<LOG_GENERIC-ENTRY_time-card>>
:TIME-TRACKING-HOWTO: 

=HOW TO DO Time Tracking:= 

You can track time related to =ANY HEADING= within your log... You will mostly be working under the *üìí Details:* section where you will be tracking most of your time, but also a little time will be spent within the *‚úÖ Summary:* section at the start of new tasks... You won't be tracking time under this *‚è∞ Time Card:* /(Tracking the time it takes to track time? "OK Einstein"... LOL)/ but you may be spending time doing research for the *üìö Reference:* Section, so you should clock that time as well as Summary and Details... 

=Here is how to Track your Time:=

- *Go To ANY HEADING under your MAIN LOG Entry Heading:* 

  /(Summary, Details, or Sub Headings)/

  =Punch the Time Clock:= /(USE: CLOCKING COMMANDS below)/

  To Punch the clock at any heading use the *Clock IN:* command below, and then begin working on a task related that heading... =Your Time will start Recording Immediately= and you will see a ~:clocking:~ item under the heading where time is recorded

  Document your work under the current "clocking" heading as you do the task...
  *Clock OUT*: when you are done working... /(do this whether any related tasks are complete or not... This simply logs all the time worked so far)/

=CLOCKING COMMANDS:= /(how to keep track your time)/

+ *Clock IN:* ~C-c C-x C-i~ 

  /(Begin OR Resume Clocking Current task)/

  This creates a new :CLOCKING: Time Card Entry just underneath its HEADING...

  Do this just before starting work on the task... Be in control of your life!

  If you need to go away and do something else before finishing this task, you can do so after clocking out... When you come back simply clock back in again to start another Time Card Entry just as before... The new time card entry will appear above the earlier one within the ~:CLOCKING:~ drawer... When you clock out of this task it will look just like the entry below it with a total time worked tagged on the end... 
    
+ *RETURN to Clock Heading:* ~C-c C-x C-j~ 

  /Go back to the place where you started the clock.../

  You do this after you have worked on a task for a while and you need to come back to update the item's info etc., and/or stop the clock before going off to do something else unrelated to the log entry... 

+ *Clock OUT:* ~C-c C-x C-o~ 

  /(to stop clocking your time on task)/

  This *Finalizes the Time Card Entry* within: ~:CLOCKING:~ /(created earlier when you started the clock)/

  The Clock Entry changes showing start timestamp, end timestamp, and total time worked during this segment...

  After Clocking OUT, you can go away and do some work, leaving this heading, log note, etc. to visit other files and/or work on them etc. The clock will be recording your time all the while...

  You will see in your mode line the elapsed clock time ticking away as you work on a task /(hopefully related to this clock!)/ and you are NOT Yac Shaving or being sidetracked!!! LOL

  =Please DON'T Forget= /Like I often do, LOL.../ i.e., Leaving a clock running all day by accident, or worse, leave it dangling with the file closed only to open it again and get that nasty *Org-Mode Message:* /"What do you want to do/ /with this?"/ If you do something like that you can always come back and directly edit the clock times by hand to amend them...  After changing clock times or dates, etc... Whatever...

  ="Onward We Row Mates... Through the LOG jam!"= 

+ *Update Time Card Entry:* ~C-c C-c~ 

  Go To The: ‚è∞ *Time Card* Heading... 

  Place your Cursor on the Same Line or at the Beginning Of: ~#+BEGIN:~ clocktable
  =Type:= ~C-c C-c~

  This command will change the total time at the end showing your new calculated time... 

+ *Clock Out & Mark Items Done:* ~C-c C-t~ 

  When you are all done with a Log Entry use the above key command to mark its Heading *TODO* tag to: *DONE*

  /(Most of the/ /time this will ALSO clock you out if you are still clocked/ /into the item... But not allways in my experience.../

  So make sure you are also clocked OUT of an Item After marking it DONE...

  =Type:= ~C-c C-x C-j~ to check current clock state/position...
  /(if no running clock it will tell you and place your/ /cursor at the heading where you LAST CLOCKED OUT)/ 

+ *Cancel Current Clock:* ~C-c C-x C-q~ 

  /(in case of accident)/ This removes currently running clock and forgets any time accrued or associated with it... 

+ *Display Clocking Info:* ~C-c C-x C-d~ 

  /This will show elapsed times to the right of headings.../

  =Warning!= Using this command will CLUTTER ALL the headings within your org file with those timestamps!!!

**** NEW ‚úÖ Summary: [0/3] 
<<LOG_GENERIC-ENTRY_summary>> 
:README: 
This Summary is mostly to help you find things later when you cannot remember when or where is was done... If you go to the top of this file and expand all headings to show ALL content, then do a search on "~Summary:~" you will be able to quickly scroll through and scan these summaries quickly to find what you were looking for... 

Also the *Time Card* /displayed above/ each search hit will give more clues by showing important headings you worked on...

Below is an optional list /(that could also provide links)./ This list could be used to itemize things you worked on, but I personally find it easier to simply write a short one or two
line description containing important keywords right here and nothing more. I think that is more useful...
:END:

The SUMMARY section is a sort of EXPANDED TABLE OF CONTENTS so-to-speak.. Providing a bit more info than a TOC would provide normally... Useful for your LOGGING WORKFLOW...
Putting the summary section all together provides an excellent EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW of your PROJECTS... ANCHORS provide easy navigation from summary to details for each item...

Commandeer all of the examples below changing their titles both in the heading as well as the lower case title part of the link anchors...

*** COPY-PASTE ITEMS: 

- =INLINE IMAGES:= 
  Use this to place an image centered on the page when rendered on the Web...
  
  The image will not Auto Expand in org-mode, -and- if it becomes Visible, you can easily turn it OFF if you don't want it. (i.e. to save vertical space while editing)...

  *Type:* ~C-c~  ~C-x~ ~C-v~ to toggle visibility... 
  #+NAME: Figure:RDME-LOG_object-name 
  #+ATTR_ORG: :align left
  #+ATTR_HTML: :align center
  #+ATTR_HTML: :width 600px
  #+CAPTION: This is The Caption for a table, graph, image, or etc...
    [[./media/svg/monochord.svg]]

- =TABLES:= 

  Lets See how VERSE blocks effect HTML output... I normally use CENTERED blocks...

  #+CAPTION: Org-Mode BOILERPLATE Table
  #+begin_verse

  #+end_verse

- =Generate TABLE from SRC CODE Block:= 

  =NOTE:= You must have iTerm running for this zsh command to work... I have not tried this with BASH, but I like the output table here so that is fine...

  Use this to generate a raw org-mode table for some data you need via a script, SHELL, Python, whatever... Then once the table is made you can copy it, fix up headings etc., add a NAME: and CAPTION: to it and place it where you need it... /(I should make capture templates or ya-snippets for this stuff but NOT YET)/.. First do it manually, then automate... 

  #+begin_src zsh :results table :exports both 
  ps -a 
  #+end_src 

  #+RESULTS:
  |   PID | TTY     |    TIME | CMD |
