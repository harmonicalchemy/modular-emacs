:READ_ME_FIRST: 
☞ =Instructions:= /(How to Install & Use This Template)/

=Last Modified:= <2024-05-19 Sun>

To use *HAP_Technical-Book-Project-Skeleton.org* /(Org-Mode Reference Book/
/Project /Template)/ for your own projects, =Perform The Following Steps:= 

/Use the org-mode Checkboxes to Help You Keep Track of Progress/

1) [ ] *Clone a Copy of This File:* 

      Put your clone where you normally organize your writing 
      projects. *Place it within its own MASTER FOLDER... It is*
      *Important to keep this file within its OWN enclosing folder!* 

      Name the project's MASTER FOLDER to reflect your Referenc book 
      project's title... /(what you renamed this .org file to)/...

      =Other Files/Folders will be placed within this MASTER FOLDER...=

      You may put this file within other Master Project Folders that
      contain existing ~.org~ files /(cloned from other HAP_Doc-Skeleton/
      /template files)/ =If This is the case:= *Skip Steps 2 & 3 below...*

      =Do NOT OVERWRITE ANY PRE-EXISTING FILES or FOLDERS!!!=

      =Otherwise:=
      
      *Name This New Project's MASTER FOLDER* to reflect your Reference
      book project's title... /(what you renamed this .org file to)/...

2) [ ] *Copy/Clone:* ~./media~ /(and contents)/ *to your new project's MASTER FOLDER:*
      /(skip this step if this folder already exists within your project)/

      Copy this directory /(into your master folder as a sibling of this file).../ 
      Any external documents or images referenced by your book project should 
      be placed within this ~./media/~ directory...

      There are images within the ~./media/~ directory that are required by
      boilerplate examples within this template... You may inspect/copy etc.,
      these boilerplate examples /(with links to media files)/ to get your
      own images, and external attachments linked and published properly...  

      This single ~./media~ directory will serve media and external attachments 
      for all of the ~.org~ doc template files copied from: ~.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps~ 
      directory /(if they ARE later copied here to this Project's Master Folder)/

      If you Decide Later to copy another doc template file from:
      ~.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps~, =YOU WILL BE SKIPPING THIS STEP= to avoid
      OVERWRITING existing files and/or folders!!!

      =Note:= You DON'T need to copy the ~./auto/~ directory... That directory
            will be automatically created the first time you export this ~.org~ 
            file to ~.PDF~...

3) [ ] *Copy/Clone:* ~./org-templates~ /(and contents)/ *to your project's MASTER FOLDER:*
      /(skip this step if this folder already exists within your project)/

      Copy this directory to your book's MASTER FOLDER,
      /(i.e., as a sibling/ /of this .org file).../

      =Note:= The SETUPFILE: ~ref-book.org~ Within this directory is called
            out and included by this ~.org~ file /(above)/ and as such must stay
            within this directory...

      Other SETUPFILES within this directory are required by other book
      project templates... /(if they are to ALSO be cloned here)/

      If you Decide Later to copy another ~HAP_<book-template>.org~ Document
      Template file from: ~.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps~, =YOU WILL BE SKIPPING THIS STEP=
      to avoid OVERWRITING existing files and/or folders!!!

4) [ ] =Start Sketching Out Your Technical Book NOW Before You Loose It!=

      =NOTE:= You may be doing this because you have technical information that
            needs to be writtin now before you forget! =Right?= Therefore...
            as soon as you are done with the first steps above, =STOP= and go
            immediately to the:

                💡 *Ideas Scratchpad Refile* Binder...

            and read the ~:README:~ directly under the *☞ Start Here!* heading...

            Then write your ideas down quickly /(as per the README instructions)/ 
            to get your information recorded before you forget it...  

            Later, After you have all your ideas sketched out and you are 
            ready to be in an ="organized mood"= /(rather than creative mood)/ 
            /This does not imply being organized cannot be a CREATIVE PROCESS/ 
            Then it is time to:

            =Come Back Here And Finish Setting Up Your Project...=

            *This Project Template is HUGE!*

            *Your Muse Can Easily Loose Her Inspiration!*

            =The= 💡 *Ideas Scratchpad Refile* =Binder is Your Remedy=

            =Do That first!=

5) [ ] *Finish Setting up this Project LATER...* [0/9]

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TITLE:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

          Change to: /"your Technical Book Project's Title"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

          Change to: /"your-tehcnical-Book-Project's-Title.pdf"/
          This will be the file name(s) produced during export thence forward
          /(including auto generated files: .tex, etc...)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Copyright © 2022:~ *directive top of this file:*

          Change to: /"Copyright © your info here"/ You are the copyright
          owner of your own documents created from clones of these master
          templates... /(but these MASTER Template Files are to stay under/
          /Harmonic Alchemy Productions copyright. Any Attribution to me/
          /for the template structure of your published docs will be/
          /appreciated... but unnecessary... Thanks! ;-)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+AUTHOR:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

          Change to: /"your NAME"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+EMAIL:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

          Change to: /"your EMAIL"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Created:~ *TIMESTAMP at the top of this file:* 

          Put your cursor on the TIMESTAMP: /i.e.,/ <2022-10-05 Wed>
          and type: ~C-c . . RETURN~ The TIMESTAMP will update to NOW.

          =LEAVE THIS DATE ALONE after Setting It The FIRST Time=

          This Date reflects the time/date that you first created this
          new document It should NEVER change after that...

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Last Published:~ *TIMESTAMP at Publish Time:* 

          =Don't Change This UNTIL You Have Actually Exported This File=
          /(as a PDF or HTML, etc. and have PUBLISHED it publically somewhere)/

          Until that publishing time comes leave it alone as: <not-published>
          
          As soon as this is published or re-published, Replace the
          <unpublished> placeholder with a REAL TIMESTAMP by typing:
          ~C-c . . RETURN~ The new Last Published: <TIMESTAMP> will
          appear in place... Do this EVERY time you publish or update
          an existing publishing... /(this will help you keep track)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+FILETAGS:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

          Add your own tags that match the context of your Reference Book...
          
    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+DESCRIPTION:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

          Compose /Your-Technical-Book-Project's Description/ as a short 
          paragraph here... and then use that to change the directive
          above in the File HEADER...

    - *The* ~./media~ *Directory is ALL Set:* 

         Any external documents or images referenced by ANY book projects
         located within this MASTER FOLDER, should be placed within this
         ~./media/~ directory... This single ~./media~ directory will serve
         media and external attachments for this and any other related
         ~.org~ files you may end up creating here, as well as being
         the media repository used by LaTeX during publishing...

         Media required for use in template BOILERPLATE Sections already
         exists within this folder /(for all HAP Skeleton Template .org files)/
         So that is all set...

    - *Purpose of the:* ~./auto/~ *Directory:* /(you do not need to copy this)/

         This is or will-be an auto generated folder where your output ~.PDF~ 
         files are created and placed during LaTeX export. You DO NOT need 
         to copy this folder as it is auto generated during org-mode LaTeX 
         processing...

         LaTeX processing will not delete any prior files contained here... 
         Some of them will be updated, but will have backups...  Any files 
         you place within this folder will NOT be lost, unless you delete 
         them... This folder is a good place to store other temporary files 
         you may be creating, generating.. etc...

    - *Purpose of the:* ~./org-templates~  *Directory:*

         The files in here are automatically linked and included within this
         template. You don't need to change those settings unless you wish to
         customize the already customized tags, and export options.
         
         /Things are currently set up for the Technical Book genre, and/
         /the Category is all set as well... But you can and may modify/
         ~ref-book.org~ /to narrow down the category more specifically,/
         /fitting everything to this project's specific needs.../

         The DEFAULT Tags defined for all project templates are useful for
         most situations and SOME tags are ALWAYS to be defined for this
         LaTeX publishing system to work.

         /Change the SETUPFILE name ABOVE and within this directory from/
         ~default-tags.org~ /to another name and-or replace some -BUT NOT ALL-/
         /of the tags within to your own tags... see instructions inside the/
         /file.../

6) [ ] =Ongoing Planning / Writing Your Technical Book:= 

      /Change headings and structure to match your project's outline/ 
      /sections-chapters, figures, etc.../

      *Start doing the Tasks within the Tasks section:*

      =Have fun doing this...=

7) [ ] =Export/Publish to PDF File:=

      The *In-Buffer Settings* specified by the SETUPFILES above will 
      get this file looking good when exported as a Standard PDF file.  
      Once you have your project directory all set up as above you are 
      ready to export your first PDF as a test run...

         *Issue the following Emacs command:*

             ~M-x org-latex-export-to-pdf~

         *OR* If You Enabled *Xah-Fly-Keys* /"Command Mode"/ Try Shortcut:

             ~SPACE e p~

         *OR Export to OTHER Formats:*

             ~C-c C-e~

            /(a pop-up will show allowing you to choose export method)/

      After *AucTeX* is done parsing/compiling etc., new files by the name of:
      ~HAP_Untitled-Tech-Manual.pdf~ -and- ~HAP_Untitled-Tech-Manual.tex~ 

      /(or the name you changed it to located at the top of this file)/
      will appear within the same directory as this file...

      Subsequent repeated calls to the above command will overwrite your
      existing ~.pdf~ -and- ~.tex~ files! /(make backups first if needed!)/ You
      could use the ~./auto/~ directory for backups...

      =If you chose the last option above= LaTeX will output files with other
      extensions for those other output formats...

      =NOTE:= Some SETUPFILES have not been created yet for other eBook formats.
            /(This is a work in progress)/

      =If YOU EXPERIENCE LaTeX ERRORS:= 

         *Consult Buffer:* ~*Org PDF LaTeX Output*~

8) [ ] =Handling Images=

      Some Images may render too large or too small to fit on a page
      of an exported version of this file... This is easy do fix within
      your content on an image by image basis...
      
      Use *LaTeX* and/or *HTML* attributes as follows on the images that need
      to be a different size...

      =Example:=
      
         #+CAPTION: Example: Larger Size Emoji 
         #+NAME:  example:00001
         #+attr_html: :width 200px
         #+attr_latex: :width 200px
      [[~/.emacs.d/lisp/my-modules/emojis/Dabolus-Complete-Emoji-Collection/u1F3D5.png]]

So far Export to PDF in nice Technical or Reference Book Style format... This has not been tested for HTML or other eBook formats yet... We will get fancy with other formats later... I promice... I have to do all this documentation first!

/As you can see, if you been following for the past couple years, things are getting done! Albeit Slowly/

:LATEST_UPDATE: 
  <2025-06-22 Sun>

  =YOU MAY REMOVE This Drawer= from your own clones of this template if
  it is bothering you... This drawer is used for HAP Modular Emacs
  DOC TEMPLATES housekeeping...

  =HOWEVER= you may also use it for the same purpose to keep your existing
  Modular Emacs based org documents in sync with the latest updates of the
  template they were created from...
  
  =If you do wish to do the same... Read On Below...=
  
  - =INTERNAL USE Instructions:= [1/1] /(END USERS SKIP THIS BULLET)/ 

    This bullet is not for end users... This is /"Note to Self"/ stuff...

       + [X] =MASTER TEMPLATE ONLY= *Keep The Above Timestamp Up To Date:* 

         DO THIS ALWAYS, JUST AFTER YOU UPDATE THIS TEMPLATE... DON'T FORGET!
              /(i.e., BOILERPLATE content and :README: meta data)/
  
  - =PUBLIC USE Instructions:= [0/2] /(FOR CLONES OF THIS TEMPLATE)/ 

       + [ ] *FOR NEWLY CREATED CLONES:* 

            - [ ] *REMOVE INTERNAL USE INSTRUCTIONS* 

              Remove the main =INTERNAL USE Instructions:= bullet above... That bullet is only relevant to the TEMPLATE, /(not clones)/

       + [ ] *FOR ALREADY EXISTING PROJECTS*: 

            - [ ] *COMPARE the TIMESTAMPS between THIS TEMPLATE and your PROJECT:* 

                 The BOILERPLATE content and meta data within CLONES of this TEMPLATE will get out of sync after a while due to Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs version updates etc... Some NEW features or HEADINGS may have been added that make sense to be added to your existing project /(originally a clone of this)/

                 Use the ABOVE timestamp /(within the TEMPLATE and your CLONE)/ to see if the clone's BOILERPLATE content needs to be updated /(brought into sync with its template - MERGE)/ and then perform any needed merging/replacing of BOILERPLATE and/or meta data. /(e.g, *:README:* drawers, etc. even this drawer)/

                 - [ ] *Keep ABOVE timestamp within CLONES of this template UP TO DATE:* 

                     =AFTER Completing Above MERGE Step= and your clone's BOILERPLATE content has been brought up to date /(i.e. in sync)/ with its TEMPLATE... Then update the timestamp ABOVE... /(WITHIN YOUR CLONE)/ to record the date of its last sync status...

:SETUPFILE_USAGE: 

=Setup Files:=

   For Cloned Versions of this template, the file/paths below will be relative
   to your parent project directory and as such, should be all set to your new: ~.../your-technical-book-project/org-templates/~ directory...

=NOTE:= 

   ~#+CATEGORY:~ is specified within ~ref-book.org~ SETUPFILE.
   If you need to change the category, do it in your cloned version
   of ref-book.org...

   *SETUPFILE:* ~default-tags.org~ is where related tags are defined
              for use in this project... Tags defined are useful
              for most situations and some are ALWAYS to be defined
              for this LaTeX publishing system to work.
              
              /(change the name from/ ~default-tags.org~ /to another name/
              /and-or replace some (but NOT ALL) of the tags within/
              /to your own tags... see instructions inside the file)/

   *SETUPFILE:* ~ref-book.org~ is for LaTeX Export Configurations 
              to produce a Reference Book styled PDF /(With TOC,/
              /& Heading Numbering at Sub Sections and Sub Sub Sections...)/

* NEW 💡 Scratchpad Refile:                                         :noexport: 
** ☞ Start Here!

This Section is mainly to accommodate "seat-of-pants" writers /(Of Which I Have Been Accused Of... But I Also Crave The Planning Stuff)/. 

I often come here for my [[https://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html]["yak shaving"]] adventures...

Use this: "*💡 Scratchpad Refile*" section as a quick place to document ideas and inspirations as they come along... You can refile them later... 

Even if your quick inspiration was intended for elsewhere?, /(e.g., You become bored documenting tedious technical information when suddenly, out-of-nowhere, an idea for a new sci-fi scene in that screenplay episode you had in the back of your mind all day!, etc.)/

=Ummm.... Parallel Universe?= - =Sure!= You can put anything in here! We've got that covered for you in this Start Here spot. %^)

Use this section to quickly capture inspired at-the-moment ideas...
=While they are still fresh in mind=

=How To Use ???= 

/Simply Come directly here and do what ever you want.../
/"Your Crazy Daze are Covered!" Yay!/ 

=The following Shortcuts= will Help you get started as quickly as possible.
/(using Knowledge Management Best Practices)/

- =NEW IDEA Shortcut:= /Use This For Anything You Want!/

   + [ ] =Copy/Clone:= 💡 <2022-08-20 Sat> *New Example Idea* =Below:=

        =Copy the Heading AND ALL ITS CONTENTS=

        /Change your Clone's Title to Your Own Title/

   + [ ] *Change the timestamp on your Clone Entry:* [0/1]

        =Type:= ~C-c .~ while cursor is sitting on the timestamp

        /i.e., Press: ~Ctrl-c~, let go, and then type a Period/ ~.~

        A date chooser panel will pop up...

      - [ ] *Press* ~ENTER~ *to auto accept today's date and time.*

           The existing timestamp will change to TODAY...

   + [ ] *Advance your cursor and Start Writing!!!*

        Advance your cursor few more lines down to some fresh 
        empty space and Start Typing Your New Idea Like Mad!!! 
        /(Remove the boilerplate content after reading it...)/

   + [ ] *Don't stop Writing!*

          Don't worry about formatting or organizing it until later, 
          after all your inspiration has passed and you are ready 
          to organize...

          However without breaking your focus, you should add relevant
          ~:org_tags:~ that come to mind as you are writing...

          This is easy to do... Simply Type: ~C-c C-q~ Add Your Tag
          and =THEN CONTINUE WRITING...=

          Adding =TAGS= is a =VITAL KM BEST PRACTICE FIRST STEP=
          which will help you find important things you have written
          by the seat-of-your-pants, LATER LONG After you may have
          forgotten!  /(better than Google Search)/ :trollface:

   + [ ] =TODO After You Are Done Writing:=

      - [ ] *Adjust Space:*

           Adjust space between your headings and your 
           fantastic ideas below them it to one single 
           blank line...

      - [ ] *Continue Writing/Developing RIGHT HERE if needed:*

           If you are not yet sure where this NEW IDEA should go
           AND you are still inspired to write... Simply continue
           writing and developing this IDEA in place RIGHT HERE...

           =ONE IMPORTANT Point:= It is Good KM Practice to continue
           adding relevant org-tags to this item right NOW before you
           forget...

           You may not know where things belong in the beginning but
           you most likely DO Know the category, genra, etc. of your
           new idea...

           This will help you in case you forget all about it later...
           Sooner or later It will show up in some random tag search
           that way and remind you...
          
           When that time comes, you may know exactly where it should
           go and the reminder simply jogs your memory to move it into
           the right bin for further processing later as part of a
           scheduled task...
          
           =For NOW=, Don't Worry about what it is for or where to
           put it... It is still here in "dream state" which is
           GOOD... Don't scare away your muses when they beckon! 
           Get your Idea down first, no matter what state it may
           be in... =GET YOUR IDEA DOWN=

      - [ ] *You Are Free To Go Out And Play Elsewhere Little Grasshopper*

           If after writing... You don't feel like organizing 
           now? =NO PROBLEM=... But come back later and organize 
           things... =OK?= Don't create a swamp in here! 
           /And don't forget to take/ /your bath tonight... ;-)/

Having done the simple steps above any time you get inspired, you will much later in life be able to tell your grand children.. /"I got my first spark of an idea for that story back in Year, Month, Day, time, second"/ 50 years later! Now that is being organized! LOL

** NEW 💡 <2020-06-07 Sun> My New Business Idea! /(example)/
:README:
   This is a dummy example of some crazy idea that you may have 
   gotten at the spur of the moment, while you were doing something 
   elsewhere within this project...  After you are done getting as 
   much of the idea as you initally can then you can simply go back 
   to what you were doing before the inspiration segue tore you away... 
   You might want to schedule this as a todo item before leaving though...

   Later when you are free you can come back to file this or place it 
   where it belongs.  In the case of the note below it would probably 
   go in a research folder of a Sci-Fi related project...

   You can write anything you want here but it is highly recommended 
   to use the award winning *"Snowflake Method"* created by [[https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/][Randy Ingermanson]] 
   of Ingermanson Communications, Inc. 

   =YES!= It is a perfectly great idea to use Randy's Snowflake Method for 
        the development of Reference or Technical Books...
        /(Companies spend tons of money sending their top execs off to/ 
        /"Vision Retreats" for this same reason)/ It will Make them Better
        at what they do day-to-day...

   Snowflake concepts apply just as well for real-worlds as they do for  
   make-believe worlds... /(the worlds don't care or notice the difference)/

   The steps within the *⏱ Tasks:* Binder are based on guidelines within
   Randy's book... Boilerplate forms have been set up for you to fill
   out while reading his book to get a deeper understanding behind these
   dry forms and worksheets...

   - [ ] Go to the: *⏱ Tasks:* Binder and do the: *📋 Synopsis Tasks:*

   - [ ] *After Completing Tasks Mark Them:* ~DONE~

   - [ ] *Place Resulting Synopsis in Here:*

        Copy the one-page skeleton from: =Step Three= of Synopsis
        Tasks to HERE to serve as this books official Synopsis...

   When you are done with these Synopsis tasks, you will have 
   completed half the battle of writing your technical work!
   And you will have a pretty good abstract to publish ahead
   or for book promotions...
   
   Everything else you write will flow out of that initial seed...

   You will be coming back here to consult these notes for many 
   things as you promote and publish your book.

<<TOPIC_new-sub-topic-z>>
:README:
   Sub Topics are the DNA that make up the chapters in a reference
   or technical Book... Each new Sub Topic gets its own title or
   phrase... The LaTeX style configuration for this book template
   takes care of numbering chapters and sub topics for you
   automatically...

   Chapters may contain several sub topics and sub topics can themselves
   also have sub sub topics...

   =Usage:=

   - [ ] =FIRST: Copy Clone This BOILERPLATE= *New Sub Topic Z:*

        Leave this BOILERPLATE Sub Topic Z in place...
        
        =Do NOT CHANGE ITS CONTENT!...=
        
        Paste your clone just above it, /(below your existing Sub-Topics)/
        You new clone will serve as your THIRD, FOURTH, Etc...
        Sub-Topics for this chapter...

        =NOTE:= If you know for sure This WILL BE your LAST Sub Topic
              for this Chapter, =COMMANDEER= This Item Instead of
              Cloning another Copy above it... In that case YES
              Change all BOILERPLATE Content within this Item
              and compose your LAST Topic here...

   - [ ] =Commandeer Your Clone:= /(or this if it is your last topic)/

        The structure of this template is all set up for you ahead
        of time to allow you to immediately begin writing...

        Rename *New Sub Topic Z:* to a *Unique Title* and Replace
        ALL BOILERPLATE content with Your Specific Topic content
        for this chapter...

        Change the ~:noexport:~ tag to ~:export:~ for this NEW
        REAL Sub-Topic so it will show up when publishing drafts...

   - [ ] =Change The Anchor Link= /(make it unique)/

        Change the ~<<anchor>~ /(directly under the/ *Sub Topic Z* /Title)/
        to match your new Sub Topic title name...

        =Note:= I created the following conventionfor making unique
              anchors within ALL of these HAP_Doc-Skeleton.org
              Template files.

              The anchor ~PREFIX_~ is there to match the named sections
              of a book or document project defined as a standard
              across ALL of these HAP_Document-Skeleton.org Template
              files... This will help keep your anchors unique, and
              also add an extra *KM* dimension of *category* to them...

              It would be wise to follow this convention when you
              create anchors elsewhere within ALL of your Book
              Projects created from HAP Modular Emacs Document
              Skeleton Template files...

              If you wish to change all of this, go ahead and do
              what ever you want... For simplicity's sake, follow
              the instructions below... /(there are automatic ways/
              /to create links and anchors within org-mode... I/
              /prefer to do it manually... The alternate is a mess/
              /IMHO)/

        Leave ~TOPIC_~ as the anchor's prefix... /(as in boilerplate above)/
        Use dashes to connect words /(all lower case)/ from your sub
        topic's title...

        The anchor above may be used to link to this sub-topic from
        Research or other sections of this book...

   Sub Topics are the DNA that make up the chapters in a reference

   takes care of numbering chapters and sub topics for you
   automatically...

   Chapters may contain several sub topics and sub topics can themselves
   also have sub sub topics...

** 🐃 Yak Shaving: 
:README: 
=What is Yak Shaving doing in your Research Folder?= Just as the name implies, this is a place that may have no business being in your book, but nevertheless may be something you need to research on the side in order to get your book written.. 

Things to put here may end up in chapters but you don't know which chapters that may be at this point, so you cannot use a Chapter's Background Notes section for these cases...

Use this section as a place to save and organize new-ideas while you figure out what they may be for, and where they may eventually go...  

This section is a great place to start if your are importing existing docs written in markdown, or Open Office, or what ever... import the text from those external docs here first... Then you can organize them here while you figure out how they fit in the larger context of a book project...

The format for this section is anything you like.. And you may put anything you like in here.. There are NO Templates to clone for this...

=MAKE IT HOW YOU WANT TO MAKE IT HERE... ;-P=

Some of the things written *seat-of-the-pants* within the *Start Here* section may end up in this *Yak Shaving* section later when you are ready to organize things further... /(after inspiration)/
:END:
*** NEW 🐃 Yak Shaving Heading One: 

Note: This is an example of some documentation or research you need to do, the result of which will not be included in your book but will be used as a resource necessary for the creation and or publishing of your book... Add what you need here... 

Use this section's top level heading outline structure.. Create sub-level headings as needed for your purposes...

   =Using the Clocking Feature of this Log Entry=

   - [ ] *Go To One of the HEADINGS Below:*

         /(Summary, Details, or Sub Headings)/

         =Punch the Time Clock:= /(see Clocking Commands: below)/ At
         the heading And then begin working on a task related to
         that Heading...

         =Your Time IS being Recorded Now= /(you will see a/ *:clocking:*
         /item under the heading where time is recorded)/

   - [ ] =Use These Clocking Commands:= /to keep track your time.../

      + *Clock IN:* ~C-c C-x C-i~ /(Begin OR Resume Clocking Current task)/

            This creates a new :CLOCKING: Time Card Entry just
            underneath the HEADING...

            Do this just before starting work on the task... 
            Be in control of your life!

            After doing the above, you can go away and do some 
            work, leaving this heading, log note, etc. to visit 
            other files and/or work on them etc. The clock will 
            be recording your time all the while... You will see 
            in your mode line the elapsed clock time ticking away 
            as you work on a task /(hopefully related to this clock!)/
            and NOT Yac Shaving or being sidetracked!!!

      + *RETURN to Clock Heading:* ~C-c C-x C-j~

            /Go back to the place where you started the clock.../

            You do this after you have worked on a task for a 
            while and you need to come back to update the item's
            info etc., and/or stop the clock before going off to 
            do something else unrelated to the log entry...

      + *Clock OUT:* ~C-c C-x C-o~ /(to stop clocking your time on task)/

            This *Finalizes the Time Card Entry* within:
            ~:CLOCKING:~ /(created earlier when you started the clock)/

            The Clock Entry changes showing start timestamp, end
            timestamp, and total time worked during this segment...  

            =Please DON'T Forget= /Like I often do, LOL.../ i.e., Leaving
            a clock running all day by accident, or worse, leave it
            dangling with the file closed only to open it again and
            get that nasty *Org-Mode Message:* /"What do you want to do/
            /with this?"/ If you do something like that you can always
            come back and directly edit the clock times by hand to
            amend them...  After changing clock times or dates, etc...
            Whatever...

                  ="Onward We Row Mates... Through the log jam!"=

      + *Update Time Card Entry:* ~C-c C-c~ 

            This command will change the total time at the end showing 
            your new calculated time...

            If you need to go away and do something else before finishing
            this task, you can do so after clocking out... When you come
            back simply clock back in again to start another Time Card
            Entry just as before... The new time card entry will appear
            above the earlier one within the ~:CLOCKING:~ drawer... When
            you clock out of this task it will look just like the entry
            below it with a total time worked tagged on the end...

      + *Clock Out & Mark Items Done:* ~C-c C-t~

            When you are all done with a Log Entry use the above key 
            command to mark its Heading *TODO* tag to: *DONE* /(Most of the/ 
            /time this will ALSO clock you out if you are still clocked/ 
            /into the item... But not allways in my experience.../  
            So make sure you are also clocked OUT of an Item After 
            marking it DONE... Type: ~C-c C-x C-j~ to check this...
            /(if no running clock it will tell you and place your/
            /cursor at the heading where you LAST CLOCKED OUT)/

      + ~C-c C-x C-q~ *Cancel Current Clock:* /(in case of accident)/

            This removes currently running clock and forgets any time
            accrued or associated with it...

      + ~C-c C-x C-d~ *Display Clocking Info:* 

            /This will show elapsed times to the right of headings.../
            =Warning!= Using this command will CLUTTER ALL the headings
                     within your org file with those timestamps!!!

This Summary is mostly to help you find things later when you cannot remember when or where is was done... If you go to the top of this file and expand all headings to show ALL content, then do a search on "~Summary:~" you will be able to quickly scroll through and scan these summaries quickly to find what you were looking for... 

Also the *Time Card* /displayed above/ each search hit will give more clues by showing important headings you worked on...

Below is an optional list /(that could also provide links)./ This list could be used to itemize things you worked on, but I personally find it easier to simply write a short one or two    line description containing important keywords right here and nothing more. I think that is more useful...

The Synopsis Tasks provided below are important first steps to take when first starting any book.  They are based on the "Snowflake Method" by Randy Ingermanson... /(for fiction writers)/ but the universal visualization concepts apply for reference and technical works as well.

These tasks should be started as soon as you create a new project using this: *HAP_Technical-Book-Project-Skeleton* 

It is hoped that this process will give you a faster, efficient, organized "bootstrapped" head start and teach some guidance about how to properly organize and write your books with a clearer mind, 
inspired outlook, and renewed motivation...

** 📋 Synopsis Tasks:

=Do These Synopsis Tasks FIRST When Starting a NEW Tech Book Project=

After completing each Timestamped Step below, Mark its TODO state to ~DONE~ and update the timestamp to the current time as well...  Use Command: ~C-c . RET~ while cursor is on the timestamp to update it to the current date/time... 

The Synopsis Tasks below are based on The Award winning Snowflake Method created by [[https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/][Randy Ingermanson]] of Ingermanson Communications, Inc. You could write anything you want for a synopsis...

Randy Wrote his book with Novelist /(fiction writers)/ in mind but I believe these same principals apply to real-life as well... Of course... Right?  Fiction and Real Life are not ALL that
different at the end of the day... Just be sure not to be writing any "fake news" OK? Thanks... We really don't need any more of that.

=It is HIGHLY Recommended= for you to use the steps below FIRST before doing any other writing! This advise comes from many highly acclaimed authors! Not just Randy...
:END:
*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Do This First: =Important= 

=NOTE:= Before you start you need to answer the 
      following questions:

- [ ] *What is your main category or genera?* 

       _______________________________________

- [ ] *You write within this genera because?* 

       _______________________________________

- [ ] *Readers will be attracted to and enjoy your books because?* 

       _______________________________________

After completing above, follow the steps below...

*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Step One - Write a Single Sentence Summary: 

=Take An Hour And Write A One-Sentence Summary Of Your Book:= 
   
*Something like this:*

   /"A gourmet chef from Boston acedentally falls into a parallel/ 
    /world, almost destroyed by an arch enemy he did not even know/ 
    /he had, then he discovers he is immortal and meets-re-discovers/ 
    /his ancient soul mate of eons. Together they save the universe/ 
    /after all else fails!"/

OK I know... I cheated. The second sentence is a stinger. It needs to stand alone... I often buck the rules... lol

The sentence you end up writing above will serve you forever as a ten-second selling tool. This exercise defines the big picture illustrated by the first simple triangle in the snowflake diagram /(as explained to Goldilocks and/ /classmates by Baby Bear in: Chapter 4 of Randy Ingermanson's Book:/ 
/"How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method")/

Within that same chapter, Baby Bear also pointed out this important fact to keep in mind: 

   /(Illustrated "Radio Drama" Style Just For Fun, Because We Can... ;-)/

#+BEGIN_SRC fountain 

            A screenplay adaptation of an excerpt of dialog witin chapter 4 of:
                   "How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method"
                                by: Randy Ingermanson

# Somewhere in the middle of Scene One:

INT. (BABY BEAR'S CLASSROOM - DAY)

_1. SOUND [CREAKING & THUD OF TABLE AS BABY BEAR JUMPS UP ON TOP]_

2.

BABY BEAR
(RECOVERING BALANCE, GRUNT, DEEP ENHALE)
    
This is important, you novelists!
   
You're going to get lots of advice on how to write a novel.  
    
But that's all it is. Advice. If you don't like that advice, 
    
if it doesn't work for you, then ignore it.  
    
If it does work for you, then run with it.

#+END_SRC

I agree... Don't let anybody steer you away from your muses! But at the same time don't ignore the basics!

This synopsis stuff is basic to the bone! It is universal... We cannot buck it!  It's based on human nature... Your sentence above, will serve as a pitch during normal conversations /(to see if there is any interest)/...

=Memorize "your line"= to the point that you can say it in your sleep! Turn it into a "slogan" /(hopefully a "meme" if you are the lucky type)/. Your goal is that others will remember and be able to easily tell all their friends /(word/ /for word)/. Networking is the key! You can't do it alone... Songs are also great help! /(cartoons and songs are killer!)/ Social networks open you up to sky limit possibilities!

=Lead with your story line while engaging with a total stranger= or even your mother. =Remain silent after that=... Wait to see if there is interest before diving deeper... That and your good body language "posture" will take care of everything...

=Important!= Closing rules of sales dictate the law of attraction 
           always applies.. Pushing yields negative results... 
           =If you push people... They push back...= 

           =If you run away from people, they chase you...= 

           To eat, or to be eaten... That's what it all comes down to. 
           lol Wait to see if there is interest... 

           =If NOT, Move On...= 
           =If YES... Do The Next Step...=

When the time comes for you to write your book proposal, this sentence should appear very early in the proposal. It's the hook that will sell your book to your editor, to your committee, to the sales force, to bookstore owners, and ultimately to readers. So make the best one you can!

***** Here are some tips: 

- *Shorter is better. Try for fewer than 15 words.* 

- *No character names, please!* Better to say "a handicapped trapeze artist" than "Jane Doe".

- *Tie together the big picture and the personal picture.* Which character has the most to lose in this story? Now tell me what he or she wants to win.

- *Read the one-line blurbs on the New York Times Bestseller list* 
    This will teach you how to do it by example. Writing a one-sentence description is an art form. If you become a master at this, marketing firms will want you madly!

- *Check out:* [[yt:feD-dImM4a8][LEGO Star Wars: The Last Jedi in 60 Seconds]] 
    /(and other 60 second movies like it)/ for a completely different audio/visual parallel to this literary concept...
   
*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Step Two - Expand Summary to Paragraph 

=Take another hour and expand your sentence= from step one into a full paragraph describing brief overview, technical requirements or challenges, and ending with your proposed solution in a single sentence.

This step defines the second stage of the snowflake model... as illustrated by further trisections of the triangle producing the snowflake diagram /(as explained to Goldilocks and classmates by Baby Bear in chapter 5, "The Importance of being Disastrous" in Randy Ingermanson's book: "How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method")/

For this step, *visualize the story as having "three disasters plus an ending"* 
In the sense of Reference and Technical Books, Manuals, etc. Think of "disasters" simply as business or technical challenges, which in fact can be real disasters... So there is really no difference... at the end of the day...

Each of the disasters takes a quarter of the book to develop and the ending takes the final quarter. I bet this formula is the same for development and
exposition of your technical material and final solutions or conclusions...

No one claims this to be an absolute ideal structure, but it's the one that Randy Ingermanson uses, and it has a strong basis in psychology.

=If you believe in the Three-Act structure, then:=

- *The first disaster /(challenge)/ would correspond to the end of Act 1*

- *The second disaster /(challenge)/ would be the mid-point of Act 2*

- *The third disaster /(challenge)/ would come at the end of Act 2,
   and force Act 3*

- *Act 3 wraps everything up* /(and provides a final solution or
   conclusion for your technical book...)/

**** Make 5 Sentences: [0/5] 

1. [ ] =Exposition:= 

   The first sentence paints the big picture of the problem with a hint of its solution. The purpose of this sentence is to invoke a strong curiosity, desire, and expectation to learn the rest of the book's proposed solution!

2. [ ] =Second Sentence:= - *This Sets Current Playing Field* 

   Outline the circumstances of the current playing field that your book will be addressing. This is the key event that motivated you to find a remedy in the first place.  This section must hit home to our readers as well, inspiring them to follow the rest of the book for answers...

3. [ ] =The third sentence:= - *Tells them what NOT to do* 

   =Sharing Personal Blunders Is A Sure Hit For Readers=

   Here is where you get to tell some stories... past experience of failed attempts etc.  Not offering the proper solutions yet, but rather showing the palm face human events that finally lead    you to discovery of the proper methods & solutions... /(the music changes, new hope emerges out of the fog of your mess)/

4. [ ] =The forth sentence:= - *Where You Git To Hit The Home Run!* 

   This sentence reveals your final best solution to all the challenges presented, giving your readers the impression that =reading this book will help them avoid all pitfalls entirely!=

5. [ ] =Summary:= *(conclusion)* 

   This last sentence wraps everything up, further supporting the first three sentences with one single statement.  An encouragement and also challenge for your readers to read this book to discover more.

**** Using Your One-Paragraph Summary: 

You will be using this paragraph in your proposals. It is only for your agents etc.  Not for your readers who need to be kept in the dark about 
too many details until they read the book...

=However=, Some of this paragraph /(written with parts pourposefully left out or with questions put in place)/ may end up back-cover copy for your book's promotion.

*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Step Three - Expand Paragraph to Synopsis: 

=Take several hours and expand each sentence= of your summary paragraph into a full paragraph. 

*All but the last paragraph should present challenges, pitfalls to overcome.* The final paragraph is your proposed best-practice solution.

By this stage, you should have a good idea of the large-scale structure of your book, and you have only spent a day or two, or at most, a week or two, but all that time will not have been wasted! You will now have a good idea if there are going to be problems that need to be worked out. This is good knowledge to have now, rather than after investing 500 hours in a rambling first draft.

At the end of this exercise, you will have a nice one-page skeleton of your book. It's fine if your skeleton does not fit all on one single-spaced page as long as it does not go beyond that...

Your process now is to grow these ideas as individual chapters and topics.  You have a synopsis "executive summary" suitable for a proposal, and you are well on your way to doing extended promotion...

*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Completion: 

- [ ] *Copy one-page skeleton from:* =Step Three= above to the main *📃 Synopsis:* Section of this book project... 

  When you are done with these Synopsis tasks, you will have completed half the battle of writing your technical work! Everything else you write will flow out of that initial seed...

           a clock running all day by accident, or worse, leave it
           dangling with the file closed only to open it again and
           get that nasty *Org-Mode Message:* /"What do you want to do/
           /with this?"/ If you do something like that you can always
           come back and directly edit the clock times by hand to
           amend them...  After changing clock times or dates, etc...
           Whatever...

                 ="Onward We Row Mates... Through the log jam!"=

     - *Update Time Card Entry:* ~C-c C-c~  

           This command will change the total time at the end showing 
           your new calculated time...

           If you need to go away and do something else before finishing
           this task, you can do so after clocking out... When you come
           back simply clock back in again to start another Time Card
           Entry just as before... The new time card entry will appear
           above the earlier one within the ~:CLOCKING:~ drawer... When
           you clock out of this task it will look just like the entry
           below it with a total time worked tagged on the end...

     - *Clock Out & Mark Items Done:* ~C-c C-t~ 

           When you are all done with a Log Entry use the above key 
           command to mark its Heading *TODO* tag to: *DONE* /(Most of the/ 
           /time this will ALSO clock you out if you are still clocked/ 
           /into the item... But not allways in my experience.../  
           So make sure you are also clocked OUT of an Item After 
           marking it DONE... Type: ~C-c C-x C-j~ to check this...
           /(if no running clock it will tell you and place your/
           /cursor at the heading where you LAST CLOCKED OUT)/

     - ~C-c C-x C-q~ *Cancel Current Clock:* /(in case of accident)/ 

           This removes currently running clock and forgets any time
           accrued or associated with it...

     - ~C-c C-x C-d~ *Display Clocking Info:* 

           /This will show elapsed times to the right of headings.../
           =Warning!= Using this command will CLUTTER ALL the headings
                    within your org file with those timestamps!!!

**** NEW ✅ Summary: [0/3] 
:README: 
This Summary is mostly to help you find things later when you cannot remember when or where is was done... If you go to the top of this file and expand all headings to show ALL content, then do a search on "~Summary:~" you will be able to quickly scroll through and scan these summaries quickly to find what you were looking for... 

Also the *Time Card* /displayed above/ each search hit will give more clues by showing important headings you worked on...

Below is an optional list /(that could also provide links)./ This list could be used to itemize things you worked on, but I personally find it easier to simply write a short one or two    line description containing important keywords right here and nothing more. I think that is more useful...

  =NOTE:= You must have iTerm running for this zsh command to work... I have not tried this with BASH, but I like the output table here so that is fine...

  Use this to generate a raw org-mode table for some data you need via a script, SHELL, Python, whatever... Then once the table is made you can copy it, fix up headings etc., add a NAME: and CAPTION: to it and place it where you need it... /(I should make capture templates or ya-snippets for this stuff but NOT YET)/.. First do it manually, then automate...
