#+DESCRIPTION: HAP - Fiction Book Project Skeleton with generic basics already done.  Great for Authors to use when starting a new fiction book project from scratch... Publishable as a PDF Book suitable for eBook readers... (easily modified for publishing in other eBook formats or for the web)

:SETUP-README:

=Setup Files:=

   For Cloned Versions of this template, the file/paths below will be relative
   to your parent project directory and as such, should be all set to your new:
   ~.../your-fiction-book-project/org-templates/~ directory...

   *SETUPFILE:* ~fiction-book-setup.org~ is for LaTeX Export Configurations 
              to produce a Fiction Book styled PDF /(No TOC, & Numbering
              at Chapter level ONLY...)/

   *SETUPFILE:* ~default-tags.org~ is where tags are defined for this project...

              If you need to change the category, do it in your cloned version
              of default-tags.org...  If you rename default-tags.org file from
              "default" to something more specific, you will need to change the
              ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/default-tags.org~ line below to reflect
              your new file name as well...  You may change any of the tags except
              important ones to what ever you wish... Read the *:README:* drawer
              within the file for more information...

              The Existing Tags are useful for most situations within
              this context, and some of the tags MUST ALWAYS be defined
              for this LaTeX publishing system to work correctly...

              This file may be used by other ~.org~ files within this
              Master Folder... If you need to customize them specifically
              for this ~.org~ file alone, you should copy and rename:
              ~default-tags.org~ and modify your renamed copy instead...
              
              If you do this, you will ALSO need to change the
              ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/default-tags.org~
              directive below to reflect your changed file name...

              /(change the name from/ ~default-tags.org~ /to another name/
              /and-or replace some (but NOT ALL) of the tags within/
              /to your own tags... see instructions inside the file)/

:LATEST_UPDATE:
  <2024-05-19 Sun>

  =YOU MAY REMOVE This Drawer= from your own clones of this template if
  it is bothering you... This drawer is used for HAP Modular Emacs
  DOC TEMPLATES housekeeping...

  =HOWEVER= you may also use it for the same purpose to keep your existing
  Modular Emacs based org documents in sync with the latest updates of the
  template they were created from...
  
  =If you do wish to do the same... Read On Below...=
  
  - =INTERNAL USE Instructions:= /(END USERS SKIP THIS BULLET)/

    This bullet is not for end users... This is /"Note to Self"/ stuff...

      + [X] =MASTER TEMPLATE ONLY= *Keep The Above Timestamp Up To Date:*

          DO THIS ALWAYS, JUST AFTER YOU UPDATE THIS TEMPLATE... DON'T FORGET!
          /(i.e., BOILERPLATE content and :README: meta data)/
  
  - =PUBLIC USE Instructions:= /(FOR CLONES OF THIS TEMPLATE)/

      + [ ] *FOR NEWLY CREATED CLONES:*

          - [ ] =Change this= *:LATEST_UPDATE:* =drawer title:= /(within clones only)/

               Change it to: *:LATEST_TEMPLATE_UPDATE:*

          - [ ] *REMOVE INTERNAL USE INSTRUCTIONS*

               Remove the main =INTERNAL USE Instructions:= bullet above...
               That bullet is only relevant to the TEMPLATE, /(not clones)/

      + [ ] *FOR ALREADY EXISTING PROJECTS*:

          - [ ] *COMPARE the TIMESTAMPS between THIS TEMPLATE and your PROJECT:*

              The BOILERPLATE content and meta data within CLONES of this
              TEMPLATE will get out of sync after a while due to Harmonic
              Alchemy Modular Emacs version updates etc... Some NEW features
              or HEADINGS may have been added that make sense to be added
              to your existing project /(originally a clone of this)/
        
              Use the ABOVE timestamp /(within the TEMPLATE and your CLONE)/
              to see if the clone's BOILERPLATE content needs to be updated
              /(brought into sync with its template - MERGE)/ and then perform
              any needed merging/replacing of BOILERPLATE and/or meta data.
              /(e.g, *:README:* drawers, etc. even this drawer)/

          - [ ] *Keep ABOVE timestamp within CLONES of this template UP TO DATE:*

              =AFTER Completing Above MERGE Step= and your clone's BOILERPLATE
              content has been brought up to date /(i.e. in sync)/ with its
              TEMPLATE... Then update the timestamp ABOVE... /(WITHIN YOUR CLONE)/
              to record the date of its last sync status...

=Instructions:= /(How to Install & Use This Template)/
 
 =These Instructions Were Last Modified:= <2024-05-19 Sun> 

To use *HAP_Fiction-Book-Project-Skeleton.org* Org-Mode Fiction Book Project Template
for your own projects, =Perform The Following Steps:= 

/Use the org-mode Checkboxes to Help You Keep Track of Progress/

1) [ ] *Clone a Copy of This File:*

      Put your clone where you normally organize your writing projects.

      *Place it within its own MASTER* *FOLDER* /(or within an existing /project
      MASTER FOLDER that contains other cloned .org Templates allready set up)/

      Existing MASTER FOLDERS contain other files for other projects as well as
      the SETUPFILES and MEDIA required by this Fiction Book Project .org file...

      =Note:= If you put this file within other Project's existing MASTER FOLDERS
            that contain existing ~.org~ files /(cloned from other HAP_Doc-Skeleton/
            /template files)/ Pay CLOSE Attention to the Second and Third bullets
            under Step 3 below to decide the correct action to take during
            those steps...

            =Do NOT OVERWRITE ANY PRE-EXISTING FILES or FOLDERS!!!=

            =OTHERWISE:= If this is a Brand NEW Project, name its NEW MASTER FOLDER
                       to reflect your Fiction Book's title...
                       /(i.e., what you renamed this .org file to)/...

      =OTHER Files/Folders May also be placed Within your MASTER FOLDERS...=

2) [ ] =Start Sketching Out Your Story NOW Before You Loose It!=

      =NOTE:= You may be doing this because you have some fantastic story idea
            brewing in your mind and you need to write that down before you 
            forget!  =Right?=  Therefore... as soon as you clone this file,
            =STOP= and go immediately to the: ~💡 Scratchpad Refile Binder~ 

      =READ ALL OF THE INFORMATION= UNDER The *☞ Start Here!* heading and
      follow the instructions...

      =Write your idea down quickly= /(as per the instructions)/ 
      to get your inspiration recorded before you forget it...

      Later, After you have all your ideas sketched out and you are 
      ready to be in an ="organized mood"= /(rather than creative mood)/ 
      /This does not imply being organized cannot be a CREATIVE PROCESS/ 
      Then it is time to:

      =Come Back Here And Finish Setting Up Your Project...=

      *This Project Template is HUGE!*

      *Your Muse Can Easily Loose Her Inspiration!*

      =The ☞ Start Here Section is Your Remedy= 

      =Do That first!=

3) [ ] =Finish Setting Up The Rest Of This Project LATER= [0/13]

    - [ ] *Change Title of :LATEST_UPDATE: drawer ABOVE:*

         AFTER Cloning, Change *:LATEST_UPDATE:* drawer title ABOVE
         /(within your clone, NOT the Original!)/ to *:LATEST_TEMPLATE_UPDATE:*
         AND Follow Instructions within it...

    - [ ] *Copy/Clone:* ~./media~ /(and contents)/ *to your new project's MASTER FOLDER:*
      
         /(skip this step if this folder already exists within your project)/

         Copy this directory /(into your master folder as a sibling of this file).../ 
         Any external documents or images referenced by your book project should 
         be placed within this ~./media/~ directory...

         There are images within the ~./media/~ directory that are required by
         boilerplate examples within this template... You may inspect/copy etc.,
         these boilerplate examples /(with links to media files)/ to get your
         own images, and external attachments linked and published properly...

         All external links, images, within the boilerplate examples of this
         template may be used as examples for getting your own images, and 
         external attachments linked properly...

         This single ~./media~ directory will serve media and external attachments 
         for this and other Modular Emacs Document TEMPLATE ~.org~ files that may
         exist within this MASTER FOLDER now or in the future...

         /(IF/WHEN THEY /WERE/ARE COPIED HERE)/

         =Note:= You DON'T need to copy the ~./auto/~ directory... That directory
               will be automatically created by *AuxTex* the first time you export
               this ~.org~ file to ~.PDF~...

    - [ ] *Copy/Clone:* ~./org-templates~ /(and contents)/ *to your project's MASTER FOLDER:*

         =WARNING!:= To avoid overwriting existing files, DO NOT COPY this
                   ~./org-templates~ to your MASTER FOLDER IF ONE ALREADY EXISTS!

                   But DO follow the rest of this step so you will know what you
                   should do...

                   =OTHERWISE For MASTER FOLDERS that DO NOT already have one:=
                   *Copy this NEW directory to your book's MASTER FOLDER*
                   /(i.e., as a sibling/ /of this book's .org file).../

         =Note:= SETUPFILES Within this new or existing directory are called out
               and included by this ~HAP_Fiction-Book-Project-Skeleton.org~ file...
               /(within the file header above)/

         =WARNING:= There may ALREADY be an ~org-templates~ directory existing within
                  your MASTER FOLDER! In that case you will need to merge:
                  ~fiction-book-setup.org~ AND ~default-tags.org~ /(contained within)/
                  into your existing copies of them instead...       

                  =YOU WON'T WANT TO OVERRITE EXISTING FILES= within this 
                  directory you are already using, /(and modified!!!)/
                  but you may need to update existing files you are NOT
                  using currently if/when you DO start using them...

         Other SETUPFILES within this directory are intended to be used by
         other document style project templates and are not needed for this:
         ~HAP Fiction Book Project Skeleton~ Document... You may remove the extra
         files if you wish... 

         =HOWEVER:= If you decide to clone another ~HAP_<book-template>.org~
                  file into this project folder it will pick up its
                  associated SETUPFILES automatically because this folder
                  already exists! Consider this case if/when you decide
                  to delete other UNUSED SETUPFILES... They are small text
                  files not really bothering you...

                  /(YOU MAY NEED THEM LATER DEPENDING ON YOUR CASE)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TITLE:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

         Change to: /"your Fiction Book Project's Title"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+SUBTITLE:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

         Change it to /"Your Fiction Book Project's Sub Title"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

         Change to: /"your-Fiction-Book-Project's-Title.pdf"/
         This will be the file name(s) produced during export thence forward
         /(including auto generated files: .tex, etc...)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Copyright © 2022:~ *directive top of this file:*

          Change to: /"Copyright © your info here"/ You are the copyright
          owner of your own documents created from clones of these master
          templates... /(but these MASTER Template Files are to stay under/
          /Harmonic Alchemy Productions copyright. Any Attribution to me/
          /for the template structure of your published docs will be/
          /appreciated... but unnecessary... Thanks! ;-)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+AUTHOR:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

          Change to: /"your NAME"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+EMAIL:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

          Change to: /"your EMAIL"/
          
    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Created:~ *TIMESTAMP at the top of this file:*

         Put your cursor on the TIMESTAMP: /i.e.,/ <2022-10-05 Wed>
         and type: ~C-c . . RETURN~ The TIMESTAMP will update to NOW.

         =LEAVE THIS DATE ALONE after Setting It The FIRST Time=

         This Date reflects the time/date that you first created this
         new document It should NEVER change after that...

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Last Published:~ *TIMESTAMP at Publish Time:*

          =Don't Change This UNTIL You Have Actually Exported This File=
          /(as a PDF or HTML, etc. and have PUBLISHED it publically somewhere)/

          Until that publishing time comes leave it alone as:
          ~<NOT Published>~
          
          As soon as this is published or re-published, Replace the
          <unpublished> placeholder with a REAL TIMESTAMP by typing:
          ~C-c . . RETURN~ The new Last Published: <TIMESTAMP> will
          appear in place... Do this EVERY time you publish or update
          an existing publishing... /(this will help you keep track)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+FILETAGS:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

         Add your own tags that match the context of your Fiction Book...

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+DESCRIPTION:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

          Compose /Your-Fiction-Book-Project's Description/ as a short paragraph
          here... and then use that to change the directive above in the
          File HEADER...

4) *Purpose of the* ~./auto/~ *Directory:* /(you do not need to copy this)/

   This is or will-be an auto generated folder where your output ~.PDF~ 
   files are created and placed during LaTeX export. You DO NOT need 
   to copy this folder as it is auto generated during org-mode LaTeX 
   processing...

   LaTeX processing will not delete any prior files contained here... 
   Some of them will be updated, but will have backups...  Any files 
   you place within this folder will NOT be lost, unless you delete 
   them... This folder is a good place to store other temporary files 
   you may be creating, generating.. etc...

5) *Purpose of the:* ~./org-templates~  *Directory:*

   The files in here are automatically linked and included within this template.
   You don't need to change those settings unless you wish to customize the
   already customized tags, and export options.

   /Things are currently set up correctly for the Fiction Book genre,/
   /and the Category is all set as well... But you can and may modify
   /the SETUPFILES to fit your needs.../

   Other SETUPFILES within this directory are intended to be used by
   other document style project templates and are not needed for this:
   ~HAP_Fiction-Book-Project-Skeleton.org~ Document... You may remove the
   extra files if you wish... 

   =HOWEVER:= If you decide to clone another ~HAP_<book-template>.org~
            file into this project folder it will pick up its
            associated SETUPFILES automatically because this folder
            already exists! Consider this case if/when you decide
            to delete other UNUSED SETUPFILES... They are small text
            files not really bothering you...

            /(YOU MAY NEED THEM LATER DEPENDING ON YOUR CASE)/

            =AND= You won't want to OVERRITE existing files within this 
                directory you are already using, /(and modified!!!)/
                but you may need to update existing files you are NOT
                using currently if/when you DO start using them...

   The DEFAULT Tags defined for all project templates are useful for
   most situations and SOME tags are ALWAYS to be defined for this
   LaTeX publishing system to work.

   /Change the SETUPFILE name ABOVE and within this directory from/
   ~default-tags.org~ /to another name and-or replace some -BUT NOT ALL-/
   /of the tags within to your own tags... see instructions inside the/
   /file.../

6) [ ] =Export/Publish to PDF File:=

      The *In-Buffer Settings* specified by the SETUPFILES above will 
      get this file looking good when exported as a Standard PDF file.  
      Once you have your project directory all set up as above you are 
      ready to export your first PDF as a test run...

         *Issue the following Emacs command:*

            ~M-x org-latex-export-to-pdf~

         *OR* If You Enabled *Xah-Fly-Keys* /"Command Mode"/ Try Shortcut:

            ~SPACE e p~

         *OR Export to OTHER Formats:*

            ~C-c C-e~

            /(a pop-up will show allowing you to choose export method)/

      After *AucTeX* is done parsing/compiling etc., new files named:

            ~HAP_Fiction-Book-Project-Skeleton.pdf~
            -and-
            ~HAP_Fiction-Book-Project-Skeleton.tex~

      /(or the name you changed it to located at the top of this file)/
      will appear within the same directory as this file... 

      Subsequent repeated calls to the above command will overwrite your
      existing ~.pdf~ -and- ~.tex~ files! /(make backups first if needed!)/ You
      could use the ~./auto/~ directory for backups...

      =If you chose the last option above= LaTeX will output files with other
      extensions for those other output formats...

      =NOTE:= Some SETUPFILES have not been created yet for other eBook formats.
            /(This is a work in progress)/

      =If YOU EXPERIENCE LaTeX ERRORS:= *Consult Buffer:* ~*Org PDF LaTeX Output*~

7) =Ongoing Planning / Writing Your Fiction Book:=

   /Change headings and structure to match your project's outline/ 
   /sections-chapters-scenes-plots-characters, etc.../

   *Start doing the Tasks within the Tasks section:*

   =Have fun doing this...=

8) =Handling Images:=

   Some Images may render too large or too small to fit on a page
   of an exported version of this file... This is easy do fix within
   your content on an image by image basis...
      
   Use *LaTeX* and/or *HTML* attributes as follows on the images that need
   to be a different size...

   =Example:=
      
 #+CAPTION: Example larger size .png file
 #+NAME: example:00001
 #+attr_html: :width 600px
 #+attr_latex: :width 100px
 [[./media/lavender-banner.png]]

So far Export to PDF in nice Fiction Style format... This has not been tested for HTML or other eBook formats yet... We will get fancy with other formats later... 
I promice... I have to do all this documentation first!

=To TOGGLE Inline Images ON and OFF:=

- *Use:* ~C-c C-x C-v~ /(org-toggle-inline-images)/
  
     Toggle the inline display of linked images. When called with a prefix argument,
     also display images that do have a link description. You can ask for inline images
     to be displayed at startup by configuring the variable org-startup- with-inline-images .

/As you can see, if you been following for the past couple years, things are getting done! Albeit Slowly/

If you experience problems =Please Open an ISSUE At:= https://github.com/harmonicalchemy/modular-emacs/issues
   
Please use Issues to Ask Questions, Report Problems/Bugs etc., and Suggest Ideas for Improvement... =You guys are my Product Managers=  I am only a User of ONE "seat".
Other folks UX metrics are sorely needed!! Thanks!

=Enjoy!= - Alisha Awen

* NEW 💡 Scratchpad Refile:                                  :noexport: 
** ☞ Start Here! 

This Section is mainly to accommodate "seat-of-pants" writers /(Of Which I Have Been Accused Of... But I Also Crave The Planning Stuff)/. 

I often come here for my [[https://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html]["yak shaving"]] adventures...

Use this: "*💡 Scratchpad Refile*" section as a quick place to document ideas and inspirations as they come along... You can refile them later... 

Even if your quick inspiration was intended for elsewhere?, /(e.g., You are doing some research on some interesing background info for your fiction book when suddenly, out-of-nowhere, an idea for a new sci-fi scene in that screenplay episode you kind-of had in the back of your mind all day!, etc.)/

=Ummm.... Parallel Universe?= - =Sure!= You can put anything in here! We've got that covered for you in this Start Here spot. %^)

Use this section to quickly capture inspired at-the-moment ideas...
=While they are still fresh in mind=

=How To Use ???= 

/Simply Come directly here and do what ever you want.../
/"Your Crazy Daze are Covered!" Yay!/

=The following Shortcuts= will Help you get started as 
quickly as possible. /(Incorporating Knowledge Management Best Practice)/

- [ ] =Copy/Clone:= 💡 <2022-08-20 Sat> *Example Idea* =Below:=

     =Copy the Heading AND ALL ITS CONTENTS=

     /Change your Clone's Title to Your Own Title/

- [ ] *Change the timestamp on your Clone Entry:* [0/1]

     =Type:= ~C-c .~ while cursor is sitting on the timestamp

     /i.e., Press: ~Ctrl-c~, let go, and then type a Period/ ~.~

     A date chooser panel will pop up...

     + [ ] *Press* ~ENTER~ *to auto accept today's date and time.*

          The existing timestamp will change to TODAY...

- [ ] *Advance your cursor and Start Writing!!!*

     Advance your cursor few more lines down to some fresh 
     empty space and Start Typing Your Story Idea Like Mad!!! 
     /(Remove the boilerplate content after reading it...)/

- [ ] *Don't stop Writing!*

     Don't worry about formatting or organizing it until later, 
     after all your inspiration has passed and you are ready 
     to organize...

- [ ] =TODO After You Are Done Writing:=

     + [ ] *Adjust Space:*

          Adjust space between your headings and your 
          fantastic ideas below them it to one single 
          blank line...

     + [ ] *Continue Writing/Developing RIGHT HERE if needed:*

          If you are not yet sure where this NEW IDEA should go
          AND you are still inspired to write... Simply continue
          writing and developing this IDEA in place RIGHT HERE...

          =ONE IMPORTANT Point:= It is Good KM Practice to add at
          least a few good relevant tags to this item right NOW
          before you forget however... You may not know where
          things belong in the beginning but you most likely
          DO Know the category, genra, etc. of your new idea...

** NEW 💡 <2020-06-07 Sun> Visisonar Object /(Asimov's Foundation Series)/ 
:README:
   This is a dummy example of some crazy idea that you may have gotten at the spur of the moment, while you were doing something elsewhere within this project...  After you are done getting as much of the idea as you initally can then you can simply go back to what you were doing before the inspiration segue tore you away... you might want to schedule this as a todo item before leaving though...

   Later when you are free you can come back to file this or place it where it belongs.  In the case of the note below it would probably go in a research folder of a Sci-Fi related project...
:END:

From Isaac Asimov's science fiction series 'Foundation', specifically the section of 'Foundation and Empire' entitled 'The Mule', the visisonar is considered a musical instrument.

Unlike most instruments, this one does not achieve its effect by using sonic effects but, instead, directly stimulates the listeners' mental well-being. The number of people and level of effect depends on the skill level of the player. As this was a device from the First Empire, there were not that many people around with any skill at all. However, the Mule's clown, Magnifico, had some skill with the instrument and was asked to play for select parties on the Foundation and for large groups of workers on Haven. This may not have been a good idea...

*Chapters* are *Top Level Headings* within this *Emacs Org-mode* Book Publishing project... Built in LaTeX memoir styles insure that chapter and scene numbering work without needing any of your    input... You only need to insure your anchors are unique!

*** NEW 📝 Background Note 1: <2020-05-10 Sun> /(example)/

*Mark each note's timestamp to its initial creation time*. This will enable emerging notes for chapters to be searched chronologically, and to give you an idea of how things evolve over time...

*Add anything you need here under this heading* formatted any way needed to present the data... Sub levels are fine, tables are fine... etc.  This is your chapter's Notebook, Scrapbook, whatever any extra info/metadata you feel is important to record...

*** NEW 📝 Background Note 2: <2020-05-10 Sun> /(example)/

Each new note needs to get its own heading and initial timestamp...

It is fine to make as many sub-headings as needed for these notes
but not so important for them to also be time-stamped since their parent heading is... /(unless of course you have a reason)/

:README:
   This section is for a chapter's Back Story development... 
   The following tips will help you manage development of your 
   back stories and how they will best fit into your 
   evolving story... 

   - =Keep Things Organized:=

      + *Add Time Stamped Background Notes:* /(within the Background/ 
          /Notes section above)/ about new content added to this 
          Back Stories section as you progress over time...

      + *Add Time Stamps to:* Sub-headings within the Background 
          Notes Section that reflect back to paragraphs written 
          within this section...

      + *Add TODO Keywords* to sub-headings within the Background 
          Notes Section reflecting back to paragraphs written 
          within this section...

   Doing the above steps will help you keep track of back story 
   development and get better organized about how your book is 
   developing, what areas need the most work, seeing problems that 
   need to be resolved, etc.  Most importantly, this will help 
   prevent you from making any grave mistakes causing contradictions 
   within your story later... /(unless that was your intention/ 
   /"Alfred Hitchcock")/... In any case you will be better informed 
   by keeping things organized here where you can see them and 
   resolve them quickly...

   =The Content Written Within This Section May or May Not be= 
   =Added to actual Chapters/Scenes of your Book...=
:END:
*** NEW 📰 Back Story: <2020-05-10 Sun> /(Example)/

=Note:= This is an example of a back story related to this 
      chapter, or possibly connecting to another chapter 
      in your book... 

      Write it down in the rough here and then later you 
      can develop it further as needed. Keep Background 
      Notes about this back story as well, AND keep them 
      up to date as this story develops!

** NEW 🗡 Plot(s):                                                            :noexport: 
:README:
   Plots and Sub Plots, /(Just Like Background Notes)/ are =META DATA= 
   Not Intended to be Added back to the Chapters/Scenes of your 
   Book... The purpose of Plot Summaries are to help you during 
   planning stages where you are trying to resolve that twisty 
   mess you created... OMG!

   Keeping the above in mind while writing the plot summary of a 
   chapter, will help you get better organized about how your book 
   is developing, what directions it is taking, what areas need the 
   most work, where problems or inconsistencies may arise, etc.  

   Most importantly, this will help prevent you from making any grave 
   mistakes causing contradictions within your story later... 
   /(unless that was your intention "Alfred Hitchcock")/... In any case 
   you will be better informed by keeping all your plot tasks here 
   where you can see them and resolve them quickly...
:END:

*** NEW 🗡 Plot Summary:

=Plot or Sub-Plot Summary= /(crazy example)/

In this episode we are dealing with yadda yadda yadda which must be resolved with yadda yadda yadda.  But be careful about Yadda Yadda Yadda as she does not exist in this Season's series yet!  Whaaat?  Nevermind... She never existed... Only in your dreams... The plot dissolves into tiny specs of sand on the marble floor...
Goldfish float belly up dead in their tank due to some un-identified shockwave of unknown origin passing through the bedroom just moments before... The uncertainty brings on feelings of Not Safe!!! Oh... Ah! There you are... Sigh of relief...

* NEW Chapter Title Z /(MASTER - DON'T TOUCH UNTIL FINAL)/      :export: 
<<CHAPTER_chapter-title-z>>
:README: 

- [ ] *USAGE:* [0/2] 

   =This is the MASTER CHAPTER Reserved for LAST=

   1) [ ] =This item is BOILERPLATE= /(DON'T MESS with IT until THE END)/ 

         Do Not use this MASTER CHAPTER while you are writing your book... =KEEP IT LAST= in your list of *Chapter Headings*... Keep This Item set to ~:export:~ for all drafts...

         This Item contains LaTeX directives designating the end of the Book Proper, /i.e. the end of/ ~\mainmatter~ and the start of Appendix, Index, etc... /i.e.,/ ~\backmatter~

         =Warning:= /If another chapter were to be placed AFTER this item,/ /it would show up as a NEW section outside of the book/ /proper!! NOT what you want!/

         =Therefore This:= *Chapter Title Z* =Must Remain In Place AS IS=
         throughout the duration of your project until you reach Final Draft stage...

         *When That Time Comes, Do The Rest Of The Steps Below:*

   2) [ ] =Commandeer This as LAST CHAPTER OF YOUR BOOK:= 

         =COMMANDEER= This item /(changing the title etc.)/ as the very last chapter in your book /(Once you know that/ /for sure)/... The *NEW Scene Z* sub-heading contains LaTeX directives starting ~\backmatter~... Everyting After This chapter is BACKMATTER, /(e.g., Appendix, Index, etc...)/

         The structure of this BOILERPLATE is all set up for you allowing you to immediately begin writing it as your very LAST chapter in your book...

         Rename *Chapter Title Z:* /(MASTER - etc...)/ to a *Unique Title* and remove /(MASTER - etc...)/ in order to commandeer the entire item for your needs...

         =Do NOT PUT "CHAPTER" in your Title!=

         Built in LaTeX memoir styles create a *Chapter #* heading before your chapter title heading to take care of sequence numbering automatically...

         Scenes are automatically numbered as well... You only need to insure your anchors are unique!

   3) [ ] =Change The Anchor Link= 

         Change the anchor /(directly under the Chapter Title)/ to match your new chapter's title name...
         
         =Note:= I created the following convention for making unique anchors within ALL of these HAP_Doc-Skeleton.org Template files.

         The anchor ~PREFIX_~ is there to match the named sections of a book or document project defined as a standard across ALL of these HAP_Document-Skeleton.org Template files... This will help keep your anchors unique, and also add an extra *KM* dimension of *category* to them...

         It would be wise to follow this convention when you create anchors elsewhere within ALL of your Book Projects created from HAP Modular Emacs Document Skeleton Template files...

         If you wish to change all of this, go ahead and do what ever you want... For simplicity's sake, follow the instructions below... /(there are automatic ways/ /to create links and anchors within org-mode... I/ /prefer to do it manually... The alternate is a mess/ /IMHO)/
         
         Leave ~CHAPTER_~ as the anchor's prefix... /(as in boilerplate above).../ Use dashes to connect words /(all lower case)/ from your title...

         The anchor above may be used to link to this chapter from Research or other sections of this book...
         /(Or even from/ ~.org~ /docs OUTSIDE of this file...)/
         
         /(which may or may not be published as links within the PDF)/

   4) [ ] =Replace ALL BOILERPLATE Within This CHAPTER= 

         *Add Your Content:* Paragraphs, Sub Headings, Lists, Tables, Figures, Images, etc...

         =Keep the Structure Of:= *Chapter / Scene)* =Intact...=

         Anything you do under *Scene* Level will be automatically handled during export...

         =Note:= /Usually/ *Fiction* /does not contain any Headings below/ /Scenes, but if you do have some special headings/ /e.g., A Figure, Map, Etc., /within your novel under/ /the Scene Heading, Make Anchors to these sub-headings/ /Unique! You can also employ LaTeX Inline Properties/ /to get special items looking nice within Scenes.../

   5) [ ] =Add New Scenes as Needed= 

         Commandeer *Scenes X* as needed when first starting out on this LAST Chapter... Read the *:README:* drawer under the Scene headings for more info...

         After that, =COPY/CLONE= *New Scene Y* to make more scenes as needed until you are finally planning to write your very last scene at the END of this book and ALL scenes before          that are in final draft stage...
         
         Leave the original *New Scene Z* in place =AS IS= to be commandeered later to the VERY LAST Scene in the Book...
         
         Read the *:README:* drawer under *New Scene Z* heading for more info...

   6) [ ] =Make Sure= *New Scene Z:* /(below)/ is commandeered as =LAST SCENE= 

         The *New Scene Z:* heading contains LaTeX directive: ~\backmatter~ and ~\appendix~ which means it MUST Be placed as the LAST Scene of your BOOK proper...

         The LaTeX directive at the end of *New Scene Z* /(or title you change it to)/ must be left =AS IS= when you are commandeering the scene to fit in as the last scene in your book...

         Do NOT touch *New Scene Z* until you are ready, and leave it tagged for ~:export:~ containing LaTeX directives, no matter what...

   1) [ ] =Make Sure= *New Scene Z:* is commandeered =LAST=

         This Scene MUST Be placed and appear as the LAST
         Scene in the LAST Chapter of your BOOK proper...

   2) [ ] =Commandeer Scene Z when you are READY:=

         =WARNING= Don't Do This UNTIL you KNOW FOR SURE this will be your
                  very LAST Scene within your very LAST Chapter of your
                  Book... Until that time DON'T TOUCH THIS Scene Z
                  BOILERPLATE...
     
         The structure of this template is all set up for you ahead
         of time to allow you to immediately begin writing...

         Rename *New Scene Z:* to a *Unique Title* and commandeer the
         entire item for your specific needs...

         =Do NOT PUT "Scene" in your Title!=

         Built in LaTeX memoir styles create a *Scene #* heading
         before your scene title heading to take care of sequence
         numbering automatically...

         You only need to insure your anchors are unique!

   3) [ ] =Change The Anchor Link= /(make it unique)/

         Change the _<<anchor>_ /(directly under your renamed/ *Scene* /heading)/
         to match your new renamed scene title...

         =Note:= I created the following convention for making unique
                anchors within ALL of these HAP_Doc-Skeleton.org
                Template files.

                The anchor ~PREFIX_~ is there to match the named sections
                of a book or document project defined as a standard
                across ALL of these HAP_Document-Skeleton.org Template
                files... This will help keep your anchors unique, and
                also add an extra *KM* dimension of *category* to them...

                It would be wise to follow this convention when you
                create anchors elsewhere within ALL of your Book
                Projects created from HAP Modular Emacs Document
                Skeleton Template files...

                If you wish to change all of this, go ahead and do
                what ever you want... For simplicity's sake, follow
                the instructions below... /(there are automatic ways/
                /to create links and anchors within org-mode... I/
                /prefer to do it manually... The alternate is a mess/
                /IMHO)/
         
         Leave ~SCENE_~ as the anchor's prefix...
         /(as in boilerplate above)/ Use dashes to connect words
         /(all lower case)/ from your scene's title...

         The anchor above may be used to link to this Scene from
         Research or other sections of this project...
         /(Or even from/ ~.org~ /docs OUTSIDE of this file...)/

         /(which may or may not be published as links within the PDF)/

   This section is for a chapter's Back Story development... 
   The following tips will help you manage development of your 
   back stories and how they will best fit into your 
   evolving story... 

   - =Keep Things Organized:=

      + *Add Time Stamped Background Notes:* /(within the Background/ 
          /Notes section above)/ about new content added to this 
          Back Stories section as you progress over time...

      + *Add Time Stamps to:* Sub-headings within the Background 
          Notes Section that reflect back to paragraphs written 
          within this section...

      + *Add TODO Keywords* to sub-headings within the Background 
          Notes Section reflecting back to paragraphs written 
          within this section...

   Doing the above steps will help you keep track of back story 
   development and get better organized about how your book is 
   developing, what areas need the most work, seeing problems that 
   need to be resolved, etc.  Most importantly, this will help 
   prevent you from making any grave mistakes causing contradictions 
   within your story later... /(unless that was your intention/ 
   /"Alfred Hitchcock")/... In any case you will be better informed 
   by keeping things organized here where you can see them and 
   resolve them quickly...

   =The Content Written Within This Section May or May Not be= 
   =Added to actual Chapters/Scenes of your Book...=
:END:
*** NEW Back Story: <2020-05-10 Sun> /(Example)/

=Note:= This is an example of a back story related to this 
      chapter, or possibly connecting to another chapter 
      in your book... 

      Write it down in the rough here and then later you 
      can develop it further as needed. Keep Background 
      Notes about this back story as well, AND keep them 
      up to date as this story develops!

** 🗡 Plot(s):                                                                        :noexport:

   Plots and Sub Plots, /(Just Like Background Notes)/ are =META DATA= 
   Not Intended to be Added back to the Chapters/Scenes of your 
   Book... The purpose of Plot Summaries are to help you during 
   planning stages where you are trying to resolve that twisty 
   mess you created... OMG!

   Keeping the above in mind while writing the plot summary of a 
   chapter, will help you get better organized about how your book 
   is developing, what directions it is taking, what areas need the 
   most work, where problems or inconsistencies may arise, etc.  

   Most importantly, this will help prevent you from making any grave 
   mistakes causing contradictions within your story later... 
   /(unless that was your intention "Alfred Hitchcock")/... In any case 
   you will be better informed by keeping all your plot tasks here 
   where you can see them and resolve them quickly...
:END:

*** NEW 🗡 Plot Summary:

=Plot or Sub-Plot Summary= /(example)/

In this chapter we are dealing with yadda yadda yadda which must be resolved with yadda yadda yadda.  But be careful about Yadda Yadda Yadda as she does not exist in this book at all!  What?  Nevermind... She never existed... Only in your dreams...

=Using the Clocking Feature of this Log Entry=

- [ ] *Go To One of the HEADINGS Below:* 

         /(Summary, Details, or Sub Headings)/

         =Punch the Time Clock:= /(see Clocking Commands: below)/ At the heading And then begin working on a task related to that Heading...

         =Your Time IS being Recorded Now= /(you will see a/ *:clocking:* /item under the heading where time is recorded)/

- [ ] =Use These Clocking Commands:= /to keep track your time.../ 

      + *Clock IN:* ~C-c C-x C-i~ /(Begin OR Resume Clocking Current task)/ 

            This creates a new :CLOCKING: Time Card Entry just underneath the HEADING...

            Do this just before starting work on the task... Be in control of your life!

            After doing the above, you can go away and do some work, leaving this heading, log note, etc. to visit other files and/or work on them etc. The clock will be recording your time all the while... You will see in your mode line the elapsed clock time ticking away as you work on a task /(hopefully related to this clock!)/ and NOT Yac Shaving or being sidetracked!!!

      + *RETURN to Clock Heading:* ~C-c C-x C-j~ 

            /Go back to the place where you started the clock.../

            You do this after you have worked on a task for a while and you need to come back to update the item's info etc., and/or stop the clock before going off to do something else unrelated to the log entry...

      + *Clock OUT:* ~C-c C-x C-o~ /(to stop clocking your time on task)/ 

            This *Finalizes the Time Card Entry* within: ~:CLOCKING:~ /(created earlier when you started the clock)/

            The Clock Entry changes showing start timestamp, end timestamp, and total time worked during this segment...  

            =Please DON'T Forget= /Like I often do, LOL.../ i.e., Leaving a clock running all day by accident, or worse, leave it dangling with the file closed only to open it again and get that nasty *Org-Mode Message:* /"What do you want to do/ /with this?"/ If you do something like that you can always come back and directly edit the clock times by hand to amend them...  After changing clock times or dates, etc... Whatever...

            ="Onward We Row Mates... Through the log jam!"= 

      + *Update Time Card Entry:* ~C-c C-c~ 

            This command will change the total time at the end showing your new calculated time...

            If you need to go away and do something else before finishing this task, you can do so after clocking out... When you come back simply clock back in again to start another Time Card Entry just as before... The new time card entry will appear above the earlier one within the ~:CLOCKING:~ drawer... When you clock out of this task it will look just like the entry below it with a total time worked tagged on the end...

      + *Clock Out & Mark Items Done:* ~C-c C-t~ 

            When you are all done with a Log Entry use the above key command to mark its Heading *TODO* tag to: *DONE* /(Most of the/ /time this will ALSO clock you out if you are still clocked/ /into the item... But not allways in my experience.../ So make sure you are also clocked OUT of an Item After marking it DONE... Type: ~C-c C-x C-j~ to check this... /(if no running clock it will tell you and place your/ /cursor at the heading where you LAST CLOCKED OUT)/

      + ~C-c C-x C-q~ *Cancel Current Clock:* /(in case of accident)/

The Synopsis Tasks provided below are important first steps to take when first starting a novel. They are based on the "Snowflake Method" by Randy Ingermanson...

These tasks should be started as soon as you create a new project using this: *HAP_Fiction-Book-Project-Skeleton* 

It is hoped that this process will give you a faster, efficient, organized "bootstrapped" head start and teach some guidance about how to properly organize and write your books with a clearer mind, 
inspired outlook, and renewed motivation...
:END:
** 📋 Synopsis Tasks: 
:README: 

=Do These Synopsis Tasks FIRST When Starting a NEW Book Project=

After completing each Timestamped Step below, Mark its TODO state to ~DONE~ and =update the timestamp= to the current datetime as well...  Use Command: ~C-c . . RET~ while cursor is on the timestamp to update it to the current date/time... 

The Synopsis Tasks below are based on The Award winning Snowflake Method created by [[https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/][Randy Ingermanson]] of Ingermanson Communications, Inc. You could write anything you want for a synopsis...

=It is HIGHLY Recommended= for you to use the steps below FIRST before doing any other writing!  This advise comes from many highly acclaimed master authors! /(including Mark Twain himself!)/ 
:END:
*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Do This First: =Important= 

=NOTE:= Before you start you need to answer the following questions: 

- [ ] *What is your main category or genera?* 

       _______________________________________

- [ ] *You write within this genera because?* 

       _______________________________________

- [ ] *Readers will be attracted to and enjoy your stories because?* 

       _______________________________________

=After completing above, Follow Step One  below...=

*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Step One - Write a Single Sentence Summary: 

=Take An Hour And Write A One-Sentence Summary Of Your Novel:= 
   
- *Something like this:* 

   /"A gourmet chef from Boston acedentally falls into a parallel/ /world, almost destroyed by an arch enemy he did not even know/ /he had, then he discovers he is immortal and meets-re-discovers/ /his ancient soul mate of eons. Together they save the universe/ /after all else fails!"/

OK I know... I Cheated... The second sentence is a stinger. It needs to stand alone... I often buck the rules... lol

The sentence you end up writing above will serve you forever as a ten-second selling tool. This exercise defines the big picture illustrated by the first simple triangle in the snowflake diagram /(as explained to Goldilocks and/ /classmates by Baby Bear in: Chapter 4 of Randy Ingermanson's Book:/ /"How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method")/

Within that same chapter, Baby Bear also pointed out this important fact to keep in mind: 
/(Illustrated "Radio Drama" Style Just For Fun, Because We Can... ;-)/

#+BEGIN_SRC fountain 

A screenplay adaptation of an excerpt of dialog witin chapter 4 of: "How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method" by: Randy Ingermanson

# Somewhere in the middle of Scene One: 

INT. (BABY BEAR'S CLASSROOM - DAY) 

_1. SOUND [CREAKING & THUD OF TABLE AS BABY BEAR JUMPS UP ON TOP]_

2.

BABY BEAR
(RECOVERING BALANCE, GRUNT, DEEP ENHALE)
    
This is important, you novelists!
   
You're going to get lots of advice on how to write a novel.  
    
But that's all it is. Advice. If you don't like that advice, 
    
if it doesn't work for you, then ignore it.  
    
If it does work for you, then run with it.
#+END_SRC 

I agree... Don't let anybody steer you away from your muses! But at the same time don't ignore the basics!

This synopsis stuff is basic to the bone! It is universal... We cannot buck it!  It's based on human nature... Your sentence above, will serve as a pitch during normal conversations /(to see if there is any interest)/...

=Memorize "your line"= to the point that you can say it in your sleep! Turn it into a "slogan" /(hopefully a "meme" if you are the lucky type)/. Your goal is that others will remember and be able to easily tell all their friends /(word/ /for word)/. Networking is the key! You can't do it alone... Songs are also great help! /(cartoons and songs are killer!)/ Social networks open you up to sky limit possibilities!

=Lead with your story line while engaging with a total stranger= or even your mother. =Remain silent after that=... Wait to see if there is interest before diving deeper... That and your good body language "posture" will take care of everything...

=Important!= Closing rules of sales dictate the law of attraction always applies.. Pushing yields negative results... =If you push people... They push back...= 

=If you run away from people, they chase you...= To eat, or to be eaten... That's what it all comes down to. lol Wait to see if there is interest... 

=If NOT, Move On...= 
=If YES... Do The Next Step...=

When the time comes for you to write your book proposal, this sentence should appear very early in the proposal. It's the hook that will sell your book to your editor, to your committee, to the sales force, to bookstore owners, and ultimately to readers. So make the best one you can! 

***** Here are some tips: 

- *Shorter is better. Try for fewer than 15 words.* 

- *No character names, please!* 

   Better to say "a handicapped trapeze artist" than "Jane Doe".

- *Tie together the big picture and the personal picture.* 

   Which character has the most to lose in this story? 
   Now tell me what he or she wants to win.

- *Read the one-line blurbs on the New York Times Bestseller list* 

   This will teach you how to do it by example. Writing a one-sentence description is an art form. If you become a master at this, marketing firms will want you madly!

- *Check out:* [[yt:feD-dImM4a8][LEGO Star Wars: The Last Jedi in 60 Seconds]] 

   /(and other 60 second movies like it)/ for a completely different audio/visual parallel to this literary concept...

*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Step Two - Expand Summary to Paragraph: 

=Take another hour and expand your sentence= from step one into a full paragraph describing the story setup, major disasters, and ending of the novel.

This step defines the second stage of the snowflake model... as illustrated by further trisections of the triangle producing the snowflake diagram /(as explained to Goldilocks and classmates by Baby Bear in chapter 5, "The Importance of being Disastrous" in Randy Ingermanson's book: "How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method")/

For this step, *visualize the story as having "three disasters plus an ending"* 

Aristotle was the first to formulate this now well-worn *3 Act Formula* in Poetics.
He put it this way: /“A whole is that which has a beginning, a middle, and an end.”/

Each of the disasters takes a quarter of the book to develop and the ending takes the final quarter. 

No one claims this to be an absolute ideal structure, but it's the one that Randy Ingermanson uses, and it has a strong basis in psychology.

Many of the =Plot Types= described in the *🗡 Plot Idea:* /TEMPLATE/ work best if developed using this 3 Act Structure /(at least starting out... It will be easier to modify that structure later to adapt the twisty turns of your story as it develops)/ 

=If you believe in the Three-Act structure, then:= 

- *The first disaster would correspond to the end of Act 1* 

- *The second disaster would be the mid-point of Act 2* 

- *The third disaster would come at the end of Act 2, and force Act 3* 

- *Act 3 wraps everything up* 

**** Make 5 Sentences: [0/5] 

1. [ ] =Exposition:= 

   This sentence's purpose is to paint the story setting, backdrop and mention leading characters within a descriptive role... The mood is set here briefly, dripping with consentrated visions of expectation!

2. [ ] =Act One:= - *First Disaster Summary* 

   The first disaster emerges out of circumstance. This is the key event that motivates our lead character /(hero)/ to find a remedy.  This disaster must hit home to our readers as well, inspiring them along side our hero as faithful evangelists... 

3. [ ] =First Half of Act Two:= - *Second Disaster Summary* 

   The second disaster is the result of our budding hero's attempt to "fix things" after the first disaster in Act One. But things keep getting worse, not better.  As a result, our hero experiences an epiphany, realizing the errors of her ways, and resolves to do things the correct way from that moment on... /(the music changes, new hope emerges)/

4. [ ] =Second Half of Act Two:= - *Third Disaster & Standoff Summary* 

   The last half of Act 2 is the standoff between your hero and villain or obstacle... Here is where your hero's new resolve to doing the right thing begins to pay off. However this act ends with the third disaster... Act 3 will determine the final outcome.

5. [ ] =Act 3 Summary:= *(conclusion)* 

   This is where it all previous conflicts are finally resolved, one way or the other... Whether or not the lead character /(hero)/ whatever succeeds or fails.  The story once resolved ends as a comedy, tragedy, or mellowdrama... You decide on that...

**** Using Your One-Paragraph Summary: 

You will be using this paragraph in your proposals. It is only for your agents etc.  Not for your readers who need to be kept in the dark about how the story develops before reading the book! =Watch Out Spoilers!=

=However=, Some of this paragraph /(written with parts pourposefully left out or with questions put in place)/ may end up back-cover copy for your book's promotion.

*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Step Three - Expand Paragraph to Synopsis: 

=Take several hours to expand each sentence= of your summary paragraph into a full paragraph. 

*All but the last paragraph should end in a disaster.* The final paragraph is the final conclusion to those disasters bringing your book to a close.

You can employ the snowflake method at finer levels here... Breaking each paragraph into mini disasters or turning points within the main disaster, etc.

By this stage, you should have a good idea of the large-scale structure of your novel, and you have only spent a day or two, or at most, a week or two, but all that time will not have been wasted! You will now have a good idea if there are problems with your story. This is good knowledge to have now, rather than after investing 500 hours in a rambling first draft.

At the end of this exercise, you will have a nice =One Page Skeleton= of your novel. It's fine if your skeleton does not fit all on one single-spaced page as long as it does not go beyond that... 

Your process now is to grow these ideas as chapters of your story. You are expanding the conflict. You have a synopsis suitable for a proposal, and you are well on your way to doing extended promotion...

*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Final Step - Completion: 

This is the Final Synopsis Task... Your *One Page Skeleton* /(above heading - step three)/ is all set now to be formally placed under the: 📝 *Synopsis:* Heading inside the 📕 *Front Matter:* Binder, and you will use that as your official synopsis for the book from this point on...

You can come back here any time to fine tune things, and the results of any changes need to go into the Front Matter part of your book as your official published Synopsis... /(i.e., your go-to synopsis for the rest of the world to see)/

When you are done with these Synopsis tasks, you will have completed half the battle of producing your Fiction Book! The other half is getting to know your characters...
     
All Plots, Chapters, and Scenes will flow from that effortlessly... 

** 👤 Character Tasks: 
*** Character Task Instructions: [0/4] 

=NOTE:= Reset these tasks to *NEW* and reset all check boxes as well, once all tasks for a new character is done... You may run into problems if you are trying to define TWO or more characters at the same time.  Its easier to focus on one character at a time and then reset all these check boxes etc. back when you are done so that this task section will be all ready to process your next character...  /(this is your book's Human Resources Dept - LOL)/

- [ ] =Start Doing These Character Tasks:= /(when new characters show up)/ 

     Do these tasks  immediately the first time any character shows up in your writing... /(or even if this new person shows up while you are taking a shower - lol)/ You will need to nail down as much as possible in the beginning about this character's personality right away!  It will effect the way you write about this person and the dialog that emerges as a result... 

- [ ] =STOP Everything Else & Go Define Your:= *👤 New Character* 

     =Copy/Clone:= *👤 New Character:* /(Master Template)/ from: ⎘ *Templates:* binder within the ⎘ *Meta:* Binder of this Book Project... 
         
     =Paste To:= *👤 Characters:* Binder located within the *🔍 Research:* Binder of this Book Project... 

- [ ] =Use Your:= *👤 New Character* =Item:= as the repository 
     for the results of these tasks. Fill in sub items: *💬 Profile:*, *📃 Character Synopsis*, etc. as you follow along completing any and all important information called out within the sub headings and forms of your new Character Item...

- [ ] =After completing each Timestamped Step= below, 
     Mark its TODO State To ~DONE~ & Update the Timestamp to the current time as well...
          
     Use Command: ~C-c . RET~ while cursor is on the timestamp to update it to the current date/time...

     This is all to aid you while you are working on a new character... Once your character is reasonably set up... Reset all the TODO States to ~NEW~ for the next character you will be doing this for...

     You can also mark the TODO states of any of the headings within your final Character Profile as
          you are working on them there...

Some of these Character tasks are based on the Snowflake Method as outlined in Randy Ingermanson's book: [[https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/]["How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method"]]. Other tasks are based on concepts outlined within the book: [[https://www.kmweiland.com/wp-content/uploads/crafting-unforgettable-characters.pdf]["Crafting Unforgettable Characters" by; K.M. Weiland]]. 

The second book is a free download from: [[https://www.kmweiland.com/][K.M. Weilands Website]] where you can find other great books and writers resources... 

Much of what you will be filling in below is based on the above two books but no more instruction is given here as to the why or how... Only dry forms have been included here to make it convenient for you to complete this process...  

=You are strongly encouraged= to purchase and read the above two books so that you will have a deeper understanding while you work through this process...

The tasks within this section will be used to produce a *"Character Bible"* /(Binder)/ for each character in your story. The Character Bible in turn will be used to create your character's Official Profile & Synopsis... /(which is a/ /more formal and condensed presentation Binder without/ /all the worksheets, interviews, and details...)/

=A character bible is the private lifetime personell file= of a character...  It will hold scrapbook like items of importance throughout the character's life...  

There's a TV show on Amazon called: *"Hanna"* where this concept has been illustrated perfectly! In this CIA black ops thriller, Babies DNA are enhanced with wolf genes to make them grow up into super soldiers... When these children get deployed /(looking as normal youths/ /in high school)/, they are each assigned a scrap-book containing all of their *"character's"* vital details. There are pictures of family, best friends, past events, etc. Their photo is on the front cover...

=All of it is fake...=, BUT as these secret CIA teens carry out roll play /(within their fake role as normal high school students)/, soon... they begin to believe more and more that they actually "are" who their scrapbook profiles say they are and not trained CIA agents anymore! 

This TV Series does an excellent Job of Illustrating: =The Power Of Getting Immersed Emphatically With Your Characters!=

Any sub heading under this Meta: group can be utilized by copy-pasting the collapsed heading into any of your existing project sections (i.e., making a clone anywhere you need to create a new section based on the template's structure)... 

Or... You could try mashing several cloned templates together to create a totally new project heading with a totally different structure... The intent of this is to save lots of time starting up a new custom writing project.  Lets see if it helps. :trollface:

** Reference: 

Here are Links to Information that may help you utilize this template to create your logbooks in org-mode, as well as EXPORTING your Log Books to professionally typeset PDFs or To the WEB as a regular timestamped blog or as selected single pages on some other website or snippets to Mastodon...

** 📕 Instructions: [0/3] 

- [ ] *Choose One Of The Templates Below And Copy It:* 

  /(Copy the entire template and all of its contents - folded)/  

- [ ] *Paste The Copied Template As A New Clone:* 

  /(Paste it within your project's Book, or Research section/ /where it would normally belong...)/

- [ ] *Change The Name Of Your Clone:* 

  /(Change the name to a specific title needed to fit/ /in with your project's story-structure.../ /In the case of Logs or Tasks, you probably will/ /keep those titles as they are universal.../ /but you may wish to further qualify them by adding/ /a prefixed category word.)/

** ACTIVE ⎘ Templates: 
*** NEW 🗓 LOG: <2023-01-17 Tue> Generic Title /(Log Entry Template)/ 
<<LOG_Generic-Title>>
:CLOCKING-INSTRUCTIONS: 
=Using the Clocking/Time-Tracking Feature of this Log Entry=

- *Go To One of the HEADINGS Below:* 

  /(Summary, Details, or Sub Headings)/

  =Punch the Time Clock:= /(see Clocking Commands: below)/ At the heading And then begin working on a task related to that Heading...

  =Your Time IS being Recorded Now= /(you will see a/ *:clocking:* /item under the heading when time has been recorded)/

=Clocking Commands Cheat Sheet:=  /(to keep track your time)/

- *Clock IN:* ~C-c C-x C-i~ 
  /(Begin OR Resume Clocking Current task)/

  This creates a new :CLOCKING: Time Card Entry just underneath the HEADING...
  Do this just before starting work on the task... Be in control of your life!

  After doing the above, you can go away and do some work, leaving this heading, log note, etc. to visit other files and/or work on them etc. The clock will be recording your time all the while... You will see in your mode line the elapsed clock time ticking away as you work on a task /(hopefully related to this clock!)/ and NOT Yac Shaving or being sidetracked!!!

- *RETURN to Clock Heading:* ~C-c C-x C-j~ 
  /Go back to the place where you started the clock.../

  You do this after you have worked on a task for a while and you need to come back to update the item's info etc., and/or stop the clock before going off to do something else unrelated to the log entry...

- *Clock OUT:* ~C-c C-x C-o~ 

  /(to stop clocking your time on task)/ 

  This *Finalizes the Time Card Entry* within: ~:CLOCKING:~ /(created earlier when you started the clock)/

  The Clock Entry changes showing start timestamp, end timestamp, and total time worked during this segment...  

  =Please DON'T Forget= /Like I often do, LOL.../ i.e., Leaving a clock running all day by accident, or worse, leave it dangling with the file closed only to open it again and get that nasty *Org-Mode Message:* /"What do you want to do/ /with this?"/ If you do something like that you can always come back and directly edit the clock times by hand to amend them...  After changing clock times or dates, etc... Whatever...

  ="Onward We Row Mates... Through the log jam!"= 

- *Update Time Card Entry:* ~C-c C-c~

  This command will change the total time at the end showing your new calculated time...

  If you need to go away and do something else before finishing this task, you can do so after clocking out... When you come back simply clock back in again to start another Time Card Entry just as before... The new time card entry will appear above the earlier one within the ~:CLOCKING:~ drawer... When you clock out of this task it will look just like the entry below it with a total time worked tagged on the end...

- *Clock Out & Mark Items Done:* ~C-c C-t~ 

  When you are all done with a Log Entry use the above key command to mark its Heading *TODO* tag to: *DONE* /(Most of the/ /time this will ALSO clock you out if you are still clocked/ /into the item... But not allways in my experience.../ So make sure you are also clocked OUT of an Item After marking it DONE... Type: ~C-c C-x C-j~ to check this... /(if no running clock it will tell you and place your/ /cursor at the heading where you LAST CLOCKED OUT)/

- ~C-c C-x C-q~ *Cancel Current Clock:* /(in case of accident)/ 

  This removes currently running clock and forgets any time accrued or associated with it...

- ~C-c C-x C-d~ *Display Clocking Info:* 

  /This will show elapsed times to the right of headings.../

  =Warning!= Using this command will CLUTTER ALL the headings within your org file with those timestamps!!!

**** NEW ✅ Summary: [0/3] 
:README: 
This Summary is mostly to help you find things later when you cannot remember when or where is was done... If you go to the top of this file and expand all headings to show ALL content, then do a search on "~Summary:~" you will be able to quickly scroll through and scan these summaries quickly to find what you were looking for... 

Also the *Time Card* /displayed above/ each search hit will give more clues by showing important headings you worked on...

Below is an optional list /(that could also provide links)./ This list could be used to itemize things you worked on, but I personally find it easier to simply write a short one or two    line description containing important keywords right here and nothing more. I think that is more useful...

***** NEW <2022-08-26 Fri> [0/2] 👤 Detailed Character Interview: 

- [ ] *Perform a Detailed Character Interview:* 

  This is best done as a "role play" exercise where you become "the character" who is having an interview with a doctor, or lawyer, or someone qualified to keep secrets confidential etc. Some of the information below would be provided via written examination... Other things would be done face to face... You will know the context when you get to those points...

  Doing it this way will put you in the right emotional framework. You will adopt this character's normal anxiety, expectations, assumptions, prejustice etc. You will end up        feeling this character's impressions of the various questions on the forms, and you will feel this persons emotions and expectations going into a face to face interview... The results will be more authentic about the character and less, if anything at all about you the author...

*** NEW ♾ New World: /(Master Template)/ 

This Section Defines a Particular & Unique *♾ New World*

*Worlds* and *Regions* are more of an abstract concept than Geographical Planets, Satellites, Nebula, Gas Giants, etc., *-or-* Sociological Groups, Factions, etc...

**** Introduction: 

=DEFINITION:= /(from Wikipedia)/ 

/"In its most general sense, the term "world" refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything that is. The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields."/

For Our Purposes... as Fiction Authors, our definition shall be *"a plurality of worlds"* Worlds which are Still =ALL encompassing BUT= =Not Encompassing ALL= so-to-speak... 

Worlds are Different than Regions because Worlds simply "exist" without the influence of any outside artificial influence... Worlds can be quite "nebulous" ♾ creatures! Regions are based on defined formalized constraints... 

=World Creation Can be Tricky:=
 
If you fall into a black rabbit hole through the centre of the earth, /(Like Alice).../ What happens when you come out the other side? Will everyone in China be upside down? 

Expanding on the confusing =ALL Encompassing= statement from our *World* definition above, The following ideas are assumed for: *New Worlds Created Here:* 

=A= *♾ New World* =May-Or-May-Not Contain One-Or-Many= *Locations/Regions* 

=A= *♾ New World* =May-Or-May-Not Contain One-Or-Many= *Planets or Satellites* 

=A= *♾ New World* =May Be Something OTHER than:= *Planet or Satellite* 

=A= *♾ New World* =May-Or-May-Not be BASED on= *Classical Euclidean Space* 

=A= *♾ New World* =May CONTAIN or BE CONTAINED by OTHER WORLDS or THINGS!!!= 

=And For-that-matter...= 

Worlds, Regions, Locations, Planets, Satellites, COULD ALL contain One or MORE New Worlds within them! 

*New Worlds Containing Guess what?* 

=OMG Girl! Do The Math! %^)= 

/(If you write Sci-Fi, the possibilities are mind boggling!)/ 

/"Eat just a wee bit of the proper side of that mushroom and you/ /will be too big to be a dog's meal but small enough to follow the rabbit through/ /that small door..."/ 

=For Most Cases= *♾ New World:* Items will be created in conjunction with corresponding Regions, Planets, Groups, etc... /(no matter what/ /their hierarchical relationship may be...)/

**** USAGE: [0/4] 

For most common cases, you will need to create a New World as a container for any defined Regions, Planets, Groups, etc., Which... in turn were created because they are the reference       source for elements within your evolving story (book)...

However, you may be inspired to create much more interesting Worlds /(all by themselves unique jewels)/ that end up becoming Bizarr Cases that Do NOT Contain any of the classical kinds of things you might find normally within Euclidean space, depending on the nature of your story...

*** NEW ✨ New Region: /(Master Template)/ 
**** Introduction: 

=DEFINITION:= 

A Region Is Defined As: An "area" or "space" which is broadly divided by physical characteristics /(physical geography)/, any impact characteristics of inhabitants /(bio geography)/, and the interaction of inhabitants with the area's environment /(environmental geography)/. 

The word *"region"* is taken from the Latin *regio* /(derived from/ /regere, 'to rule')/ In mathematics the term: *"domain"* is a similar concept to the generalized idea of *"regions"* as defined within various geographical sciences: /(e.g., physical geography, ecology,/       /biogeography, zoogeography, environmental geography, ethnography,/       /etc.)/ And of course all of the *Exo-* versions of these as well... 

Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in the case where some governing body has defined artificial borders. 

Apart from geographic regions, there are also hydrospheric and atmospheric regions. /(e.g., oceans, lakes, rivers, discrete/ /climates of elevations above sea level)/... Add to this the infinite possibilities of *"exo-regions"* which are not even defined yet! 

/That is... Until your Muses Inspire you to/ /Define a NEW Exotic "exo-region"!/ 

Regions are Different than Worlds because they are defined by consensus of some governing body or artificial principal... Worlds simply "exist" without the influence of any outside artificial constraints... Worlds are "nebulous" creatures! 

- *This Region Business Can Be Tricky:* 

=A Region Can Exist Such As:= *The French Quarter of New Orleans* which exists inside a *city* located within *yet another defined* *region* called: *"South LA Delta Region"* which could also be called part of the *"Deep South Region"* etc. etc. etc... 

OK... =How About a Region Defined by a Street Intersection?= *Times Square* region of *NYC*, /(which is a city but also a region/ /containing many regions which also contain regions)/... 

If you are a Sci-Fi author the concept of a Location and/or region can become even more convoluted... Interdimensional regions may exist in fractal permutations all of them suspended in flux within the space of a single but fancy space ship...  A space ship which also travels through multidimensional regions of space at the same time in parallel with other instances of itself... =OMG!= 

=And For-that-matter...= 

Worlds, Regions, Locations, Planets, Satellites, COULD ALL contain One or MORE New Worlds within them! 

/(If you write Sci-Fi, the possibilities are mind boggling!)/ 

=For Most Cases:= Any *✨ New Region:* Items defined will have corresponding and related Items defined somewhere in the *🔍 Research:* Section as well... 

**** USAGE: [0/5] 

This Section Defines a Particular & Unique *✨ Region* 

Regions and Worlds are more of an abstract concept than Geographical Planets, Satellites, Nebula, Gas Giants, etc., -or- Sociological Groups, Factions, etc... 

For most common cases, you will need to create a New Region as a container for a defined Planet, or Group, etc... Which... in turn were created because they are the reference source for elements within your evolving story (book)... 

However, you may be inspired to create a smaller Region which may be contained within a special World, or localized to a planet or other body in space, or even some small microscopic region inside a single drop of water! All of the above depending on the nature of your story...

**** 🗡 Plot Elements: /(plot devices)/

Define ANY of the 6 Classic Elements below that best strengthens the structure of this story in SEQUENCE as it develops... Note the chapters, scenes, where these elements first occur and play out... REMOVE ANYTHING THAT DOES NOT APPLY...

   + [ ] *Exposition*:

          /The Exposition is where you introduce your hero and establish/
          the story setting, i.e., your hero’s world... By focusing on
          the core value at stake from the very beginning, you confirm
          genre for your readers and introduce dramatic tension by
          setting up conflict and forcing your character to act on a
          choice.

          In most types of suspense fiction, the story will turn on a core
          value of Life vs. Death or perhaps a Fate Worse than Death. Often,
          the internal value at stake is Good vs. Evil. Crime stories, on
          some level, usually deal with issues of justice and good guys
          vanquishing bad guys while lives are in danger.

          During this exposition phase, use specific details and descriptive elements to sink your reader deep into the story and make them care
          about your hero and worry over what will happen next.

   + [ ] *Inciting Incident*:

          Once your reader is grounded in the story world and emotionally invested in your character, something needs to happen to interrupt the established pattern and rock your character’s world in some way. An Inciting Incident begins the story arc that will eventually culminate in the climactic scene and ending resolution of your story.

          The inciting incident should be inspired by, and reinforce, the core value at stake in the story. In a crime story, this event—whether coincidental or triggered by a story character—works best when it reflects a conflict between life and death or something worse.

          The way you pace your story and deliver information to your reader is paramount to your story’s success, right from the very beginning.

   + [ ] *Rising Action*:

          Rising Action is where you raise the stakes and ratchet up the tension in a buildup toward the dilemma. These are the try/fail cycles, the struggle to understand the antagonistic force and find a way to defeat it through trial and error.

          When thriller writer, Lee Child, was asked to divulge his recipe for creating suspense, he said it’s not so much about the ingredients as it is about making your family hungry, making them wait. This is where you spin out uncertainty and worry, making your reader hungry for the payoff.

          I've written several articles about how to increase tension in a story's plot by focusing on the elements of suspense. The writing techniques I've taught in these articles, such as how to create cliffhangers, write an action scene, and plant clues and red herrings, will help you develop rising action in your story. Learn more about how to use these powerful techniques in your stories by reading each article (linked in the previous sentence).

          All of these writing skills will help you keep the story pace moving along through the middle, where many writers flounder.

   + [ ] *Dilemma*:

          Now we get to the crux of the story, where the rubber meets the road. The Dilemma boils down to a choice your protagonist must make—a difficult and crucial choice.

          There are two types of choices that create the most conflict and drama. The first is often called the Best Bad Choice, where there is no happy alternative and your character is forced to choose from a menu of unsavory options.

          =For instance:= Does Katniss cut down a tracker jacker nest and kill some of the tributes, or does she wait for the tributes to kill her?

          The other variety of tough choices involves having to decide between conflicting goods, otherwise called an Irreconcilable Goods Decision. In this scenario, someone benefits while someone else is harmed. There is no win/win.

          =For example:= Does Kramer hire someone to take care of his son in order to work a prestigious job, or does he step down from his career to be a reliable parent?

          The dilemma is the heart of your story. It’s where your hero demonstrates his true character development. If you’ve created a sympathetic protagonist readers care about, they will be desperate to learn how he chooses and what happens as a result of that choice.

   + [ ] *Climax*:

          Your hero faces a difficult choice in the dilemma, but the Climax is where she acts on that choice and reaps the consequences of that action. This is the payoff you’ve been building toward since the beginning. This is the summit readers want to reach when they open a book.

          This is also where your hero gains or ultimately loses what she seeks. In suspense fiction, that sought-after objective is usually solving a crime and bringing the perpetrator to justice. Or it might be revenge, rescue, or the acquisition of wealth or power.

          Whatever it is, it centers on the conflict between the core values at stake—life or death. The events in your story have transformed and prepared your protagonist for this final confrontation.

          Now it’s showtime.

          Knowing your story's climax also helps to hone your skills of foreshadowing. You’ll be able to properly place your setups and readers won’t feel cheated.

          It’s also a good idea to make sure you’ve honored reader expectations and delivered a story suited to what suspense fans crave.

   + [ ] *Denouement*:

          Writers are sometimes tempted to skip writing the Denouement of the plot, or give it short shrift.

          Don’t. If you want readers to look back fondly on your story and pick up your next book, give them the closure they desire.

          Readers need a moment to savor the climax and feel the release of tension. If you’ve done a good job creating compelling characters, readers won’t want to say goodbye right away. Let them spend a little more time together.

          This is where you validate your protagonist’s arc and reflect on how she’s changed. Even if the world around her is back to normal, she’s not the same person who started the story.

          This is also where you wrap up any loose ends and it’s the perfect place to bring secondary plotlines to a close. Read below to learn more about subplots.



**** 🗡 =B Plots:= /(Sub Plots & Secondary Devices)/

Anything longer than a short story is enriched by weaving in one or more secondary plotlines, or subplots...

You can see this clearly in just about any television episode. There’s an A plot and a B plot. The A plot is the main story.

The B plot forms a supporting storyline that plays off the A plot and may highlight theme or act as a foil or contrast to the A plot.

A secondary plotline can center on just about anything, including a character, setting, theme, motif, or problem. It can enter the story at any point and leave at any point—no need for it to run through the entire story unless that’s what serves the story best.

These Sub Plots may show up within a single chapter and they wrap up quickly within that same chapter or over the next couple of chapters... But not much longer, so as not to take the focus away from the MAIN plot of the entire story...

Brainstorm the best subplot ideas that can deepen the tension and make your main character’s scenario more complex. Finding the right way to incorporate subplots can be tricky.

=DONT LET YOUR SUB PLOTS UPSTAGE YOUR MAIN CHARACTER & MAIN PLOT...
