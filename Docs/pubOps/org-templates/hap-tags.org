=YOU MAY REMOVE This Drawer= from your own clones of this template if it is bothering you... This drawer is only here as an aid for: HAP Modular Emacs DOC TEMPLATE housekeeping/updating tasks...

TAGS are a personal thing... Therefore MY Tags /(i.e., the DEFAULT TAGS that come out of box with Modular Emacs)/, will and should change to fit your personal use case... RENAME your copies of this file within your cloned org-templates directories within your projects... Change the tags to suit your needs... Make other TAG files like this for your different categories of projects etc... and include them in the .org files associated with that category... If you are doing all that, you will NOT want to update your Tag Files LATER to match any NEW tags used by DEFAULT Modular emacs...
:END:
:README: 
The Default Tags in this SETUPFILE are defined within the HAP Controlled Vocabulary.  Many of the tags are of a universal nature that work with most work-flows, but many others were decided upon to fit Harmonic Alchemy Productions and my Personal workflows...

*You Can and SHOULD change these tags* here to suit your own personal needs...
READ THIS ARTICLE: [[https://karl-voit.at/2022/01/29/How-to-Use-Tags/][How to Use Tags]] /(HOW and WHY they are IMPORTANT)/
=Because EVERYTHING is MISCELLANEOUS in our minds=...

You CAN and MAY CHANGE HAP's CONTROLLED VOCABULARY to FIT your PERSONAL WORK-FLOW  by removing tags that do not apply, and replacing them with ones that do apply... Consult ~HAP-Controlled-Vocabulary.org~ for further instructions on how to Modify it for your own work-flows [[file:~/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/HAP-Controlled-Vocabulary.org::RDME_modemacs-hap-setupfile-tags][HERE]]

=NOTE:= Many Useful Tags were NOT INCLUDED in THIS SETUPFILE... This was done to keep the HELM list of Tag choices short... HOWEVER, the tags in the list at the bottom of this file may be used as *FILE LOCAL TAGS* for =ANY particular docs= and or projects that need them... Simply copy the ones you need from the provided list /(extracted from HAP Controlled Vocabulary)/  and place them after the ~#+FILETAGS:~ directive in your ~.org~ file's header...
