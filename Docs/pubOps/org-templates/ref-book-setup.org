:LATEST_UPDATE: 

  =Last Updated:= <2024-03-25 Mon> /(this template needs work)/

  =YOU MAY REMOVE This Drawer= from your own clones of this template if
  it is bothering you... This drawer is used for HAP Modular Emacs
  DOC TEMPLATES housekeeping...

  =HOWEVER= you may also use it for the same purpose to keep your existing
  Modular Emacs based org documents in sync with the latest updates of the
  template they were created from...
  
  =If you do wish to do the same... Read On Below...=
  
  - =INTERNAL USE Instructions:= [1/1] /(END USERS SKIP THIS BULLET)/

    This bullet is not for end users... This is /"Note to Self"/ stuff...

      + [X] =MASTER TEMPLATE ONLY= *Keep The Above Timestamp Up To Date:*

          *DO THIS ALWAYS*, JUST AFTER YOU UPDATE THIS SETUPFILE...
          =DON'T FORGET!=

  - =PUBLIC USE Instructions:= /(FOR CLONES OF THIS TEMPLATE)/

      + [ ] =Change this= *:LATEST_UPDATE:* =drawer title:= /(within clones only)/

           Change it to: *:LATEST_TEMPLATE_UPDATE:* within NEWLY CREATED CLONES...

      + [ ] *COMPARE the TIMESTAMPS between THIS TEMPLATE and CLONES:*

           ~Org-Mode~ and ~AuxTeX~ settings and meta data within CLONES of
           this SETUPFILE TEMPLATE will get out of sync after a while due
           to Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs version updates etc...
        
           Use the ABOVE timestamp /(within the TEMPLATE and your CLONE)/
           to see if the clone's settings need to be updated...
           /(i.e., brought into sync with its template - MERGE)/ and then
           perform any needed merging/replacing of BOILERPLATE and/or
           meta data. /(e.g, *:README:* drawers, etc.)/

      + [ ] *Keep ABOVE timestamp within CLONES of this template UP TO DATE:*

           =AFTER Completing Above MERGE Step= and your clone has been brought
           up to date /(i.e. in sync)/ with its STARTUPFILE TEMPLATE...
           Then update the timestamp ABOVE... /(WITHIN YOUR CLONE)/ to record
           the date of its last sync status...

- =USAGE:= *Copy/Clone* ~~/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~ *directory*:

          If you HAVEN'T ALREADY DONE SO EARLIER: *COPY/CLONE* the entire
          ~/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates directory (containing
          these setupfiles) to your "master folder" which should contain
          one or more .org files which need these SETUPFILES to properly
          get them compiled and exported to the final Document format
          they are intended for...

          =Don't Modify The MASTER Templates Within ~/.emacs.d=

          /(if you did by accident, you can easily enough perform:/
       
          ~git restore <this file>~ /or:/ ~git checkout .~ /to refresh ALL since
          you are not modifying the master branch...)/

          *COPY/CLONE:* ~~/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~ directory
          to the MASTER directory where existing .org files reference
          this contained SETUPFILE... Modify the copied SETUP Files within
          your cloned org-templates directory to suit your needs...

          *Adjust Your Cloned Copy Of THIS File Within:*
          .../<your-master-folder>/org-templates/ folder To Suit Your Needs:
  
          *INCLUDE: This Setupfile* within .org files residing within your
          /"master folder"/ which are destined to become a Reference Manual
          or Technical Book Project...

          =ADD THE FOLLOWING LINE TO THE HEADER OF= ~.Org~ 
          =FILES That You Wish To Include (use) This Configuration:=

              ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/ref-book-setup.org~

          Making a COPY/CLONE of: $HOME/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates
          master folder To your book's project directory will allow you to
          make your own custom configurations for different books without
          affecting the configurations of other book projects within their
          own MASTER FOLDERS...


- =NOTE:= *Dependencies:*

         The Configurations within this file depend on Harmonic Alchemy Modular
         Emacs init file: ~~/.emacs.d/lisp/modules/09-4-org-export-conf.el~...

         If you need to create other LaTeX Document Styles or customize existing
         ones, you will also need to override ~09-4-org-export-conf.el~
         by placing a copy of it within: ~~/.emacs.d/lisp/my-modules~ and then
         make your changes in your cloned copy...

         Many LaTeX Classes are defined within 09-4-org-export-conf.el BUT
         ARE YET UNUSED... These blocks are simple makeing it easy for you
         to commandeer them for your own use... You WILL need to create new
         SETUPFILES for them... That is where all the MAGIC happens...
         So.. in that case you will simply be changing the include file name
         within the lisp code block for that "unused" Named LaTeX Class...

         In the current version of Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs, there is
         little need to go to the lisp level to get nice LaTeX docs for MOST
         situations... Use the supplied Emacs Org-Mode Setupfiles and make
         your customizations there alone...

         Find: =LaTeX CONFIGURATIONS FOR: --> Reference Book PDF:= Below:

         Modify or add new configurations and even ~\\input~ external LaTeX
         files with even more fancy modifications if you need that...

         You will need to study *LaTeX* a LOT, and in particular, the *"memoir"*
         document class... =Read The Well Documented Docs=
         
         /(see reference section below)/

         Once you have tried this several times /(and failed)/ it won't look so
         complicated and you will begin to "get it"... /(Be Diligent! TeX/LaTeX/
         /IS a complicated Turing Complete Language... Created by one of the/
         /Geekiest GEEKS of Computer Science, Mathematics, and Algorithm Analysis!/
         /Donald Knuth... You have been warned!!!)/

         =Good luck!=


- =HERE ARE A FEW Org-Mode LaTeX Tips:=

  /(I may add a few more here as I find them, i.e., if I find them to
  be common  hurdles/caveats for most folks)/

    + Prevent Headlines from Showing Up in the *TOC*

       Set any *HEADING* within your ~.org~ project file with the
       following *:PROPERTIES:* BOX...

       *Set The NOTOC Property:* /(NOT in TOC)/

         ~*~ =ANY Section HEADING:=
         *:PROPERTIES:*
         :       :NOTOC: t
         *:END:*

         Don't copy this pretty text example... It is NOT code... LOL
