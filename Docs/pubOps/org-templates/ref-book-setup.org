:LATEST_UPDATE:
  =Last Updated:= <2023-02-18 Sat> /(this template needs work)/

  =YOU MAY REMOVE This Drawer= from your own clones of this template if
  it is bothering you... This drawer is used for HAP Modular Emacs
  DOC TEMPLATES housekeeping...

  =HOWEVER= you may also use it for the same purpose to keep your existing
  Modular Emacs based org documents in sync with the latest updates of the
  template they were created from...
  
  =If you do wish to do the same... Read On Below...=
  
  - =INTERNAL USE Instructions:= /(END USERS SKIP THIS BULLET)/

    This bullet is not for end users... This is /"Note to Self"/ stuff...

    + [ ] =MASTER TEMPLATE ONLY= *Keep The Above Timestamp Up To Date:*

        *DO THIS ALWAYS*, JUST AFTER YOU UPDATE THIS SETUPFILE...
        =DON'T FORGET!=

  - =PUBLIC USE Instructions:= /(FOR CLONES OF THIS TEMPLATE)/

    + [ ] =Change this= *:LATEST_UPDATE:* =drawer title:= /(within clones only)/

         Change it to: *:LATEST_TEMPLATE_UPDATE:* within NEWLY CREATED CLONES...

    + [ ] *COMPARE the TIMESTAMPS between THIS TEMPLATE and CLONES:*

         ~Org-Mode~ and ~AuxTeX~ settings and meta data within CLONES of
         this SETUPFILE TEMPLATE will get out of sync after a while due
         to Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs version updates etc...
        
         Use the ABOVE timestamp /(within the TEMPLATE and your CLONE)/
         to see if the clone's settings need to be updated...
         /(i.e., brought into sync with its template - MERGE)/ and then
         perform any needed merging/replacing of BOILERPLATE and/or
         meta data. /(e.g, *:README:* drawers, etc.)/

    + [ ] *Keep ABOVE timestamp within CLONES of this template UP TO DATE:*

         =AFTER Completing Above MERGE Step= and your clone has been brought
         up to date /(i.e. in sync)/ with its STARTUPFILE TEMPLATE...
         Then update the timestamp ABOVE... /(WITHIN YOUR CLONE)/ to record
         the date of its last sync status...

=Usage:= *Copy/Clone* this file and adjust to suit your needs...
       *Include* this SETUPFILE within ~.org~ files destined to become
       *Reference Manual or Technical Book Projects*...

       *COPY/CLONE:* ~~/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~ directory
       to the MASTER directory where existing .org files reference
       this contained SETUPFILE... Modify the copied SETUP Files within
       your cloned org-templates directory to suit your needs...

       =Don't Modify The MASTER Templates Within ~/.emacs.d=

       /(if you did by accident, simply: ~git checkout .~ to refresh)/

  =Add:= the following line to the Header of ~.Org~ Files that need to
        include this file:

        ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/ref-book-setup.org~

/Making a COPY/CLONE of:/ ~$HOME/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~ /master/
/folder To your book's project directory will allow you to make your own custom/
/configurations for different books without affecting the configurations of other/
/book projects within their own MASTER FOLDERS.../

=NOTE:= The Configurations within this file depend on Harmonic Alchemy Modular
      Emacs init file: ~~/.emacs.d/lisp/modules/09-4-org-export-conf.el~...

      If you need to create other LaTeX Document Styles or customize existing
      ones, you will also need to override ~09-4-org-export-conf.el~
      by placing a copy of it within: ~~/.emacs.d/lisp/my-modules~ and then
      make your changes in your cloned copy...

      Find the: ~BEGIN: CUSTOM LaTeX CONFIGURATIONS for EXPORT to PDF~
      heading within that file... You can modify or add new configurations and
      even ~\\input~ external LaTeX files with even more fancy modifications...

      You will need to study *LaTeX* a LOT, and in particular, the *"memoir"* document
      class... =read the well documented docs= /(see reference section below)/

      Once you have tried this several times /(and failed)/ it won't look so
      complicated and you will begin to "get it"... /(Be Diligent! TeX/LaTeX/
      /IS a complicated Turing Complete Language... Created by one of the/
      /Geekiest GEEKS of Computer Science, Mathematics, and Algorithm Analysis!/
      /Donald Knuth... You have been warned!!!)/

      =Good luck!=
