:LATEST_UPDATE: 
=Last Updated:= <2025-03-29 Sat> 

=YOU MAY REMOVE This Drawer= from your own clones of this template if it is bothering you... This drawer is only here as an aid for: HAP Modular Emacs DOC TEMPLATE housekeeping/updating tasks...

=HOWEVER= you may also wish use the instructions here for the same purpose... i.e., to keep your existing Modular Emacs based org documents /(created with this template)/ in sync with the latest updates of the template they were cloned from... =NOTE:= If you have CHANGED MANY of the settings within your clone since the last template update you are advised to do a VISUAL diff /(i.e., visually line by line, not automated)/ of the two files to see whether you want to switch your settings to the new updated ones... It all depends on your use case... so check that first...

=If you do wish employ this little project management thing... Read On Below...= 

- =INTERNAL USE Instructions:= [1/1] /(END USERS SKIP THIS BULLET)/ 

    This bullet is not for end users... This is my /"Note to Self"/ stuff...

     - [X] =MASTER TEMPLATE ONLY= *Keep The Above Timestamp Up To Date:* 

         *DO THIS ALWAYS*, JUST AFTER YOU UPDATE THIS SETUPFILE... =DON'T FORGET!= 

- =PUBLIC USE Instructions:= [0/3] /(FOR CLONES OF THIS TEMPLATE)/ 

     - [ ] *REMOVE INTERNAL USE Instructions* /(and all under the bullet)/ 

          You don't need this in the file you created from a clone of this template...

     - [ ] *UPDATE Last Updated:* ~<timestamp>~ After Making Changes to this file: 

          Copies of this file within your own projects will change over time as you try out different OPTIONS etc... You need to keep track of the LAST time this file was changed within your projects... /(and you may have copies of this file in many projects)/ All of them may have different settings after time goes on... The =Last Updated:= heading above lets you know when those changes happened... That knowledge will help you when you are comparing updated template files from the repository...

     - [ ] *COMPARE the TIMESTAMPS between THIS TEMPLATE and your CLONES:* 

          ~Org-Mode~ and ~AuxTeX~ settings and meta data within CLONES of this SETUPFILE TEMPLATE will get out of sync after a while due to Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs version updates etc...
        
          =Use the ABOVE timestamp= /(within this TEMPLATE and your CLONE of it)/ to see if the clone's settings need to be updated... /(i.e., brought into sync with its template - MERGE)/ and then perform any needed merging/replacing of BOILERPLATE and/or meta data. /(e.g, *:README:* drawers, etc.)/

          =NOTE:= You may have purposefully changed some of the actual SETTINGS/OPTIONS below so be careful not to sync those OPTIONS with the new template update if the feature of those OPTIONS are NOT your intention... =ALSO=... If the timestamp in your cloned version of this file is NEWER than the template... You don't have to do anything because that was done before already... Updating the TEMPLATES themselves is another story...  You need to do that in a local git branch keeping your own local commits to that branch only so that the master tracking branch can stay clean... /(that way you will have your own set of customized TEMPLATES to use)/ while still having the DEFAULT TEMPLATES in the master branch...

=File:= ~~/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates/log-book-setup.org~

=ORG-MODE SETUPFILE for: Journals or LOG Notebooks=

None of the content or annotations in this SETUPFILE are exported to PDF or WEB...
Its Best to view this file within a CODING Frame /(as if it were source code)/

:README: 
=Usage:= *Copy/Clone* this file and adjust to suit your needs... *Include* this SETUPFILE within ~.org~ files destined to become *LOG Notebooks*...

*COPY/CLONE:* ~~/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~ directory to the MASTER directory where existing .org files reference this contained SETUPFILE... Modify the copied SETUP Files within your cloned org-templates directory to suit your needs...

=Don't Modify The MASTER Templates Within ~/.emacs.d= 
/(if you did by accident, you can easily enough perform:/ 
       
   ~git restore <this file>~

   =or:= ~git checkout .~

/to refresh ALL since you are not modifying the master branch...)/

=Add:= The following line to the Header of ~.Org~ Files that need to include this file:

   ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/log-book-setup.org~

/Making a COPY/CLONE of:/ ~$HOME/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~ /master folder To your book's project directory will allow you to make your own custom configurations for different books or other docs, without affecting the configurations of other book projects within their own MASTER FOLDERS.../

=NOTE:= Modular Emacs Config File: ~~/.emacs.d/lisp/modules/09-4-org-export-conf.el~ DEPENDS on the Configurations contained within this startup file...

If you need to create other LaTeX Document Styles or customize existing ones, you will also need to override ~09-4-org-export-conf.el~ by placing a copy of it within: ~~/.emacs.d/lisp/my-modules~ and then make your changes in your cloned copy...

Find the: ~BEGIN: CUSTOM LaTeX CONFIGURATIONS for EXPORT to PDF~ heading within that file... Then scroll down till you get inside the ~(with-eval-after-load 'ox-latex~ line... Then scroll down some more until you find the first (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes block (form)...

Copy any of the ~add-to-list~ blocks that you see, as a template... /(copy the heading comment to that block as well)/. Paste your copy between existing blocks /(with their comment headings)/ and change the heading to describe your new export document type,class, etc... Then modify the actual block so that it defines your NEW document type... You will also have to create a NEW SETUP.tex file for the \\input{~/.emacs.d/Docs/TeX/???-setup.tex} that you will need to also create, /(most likely from another one that you cloned as a template)/

It's a LOT of work, /(research)/ but worth it in the end when you have something looking really nice!

The ~logbook~ =CLASS= defined within: ~09-4-org-export-conf.el~ Uses: ~~/.emacs.d/Docs/TeX/log-book-setup-2.tex~ for its *LaTeX* Configuration...

=For Local Customizing:= You will have to edit your local CLONED copy of: ~09-4-org-export-conf.el~... /(as per above NOTE...)/ Find the ~"logbook"~ section within ~org-latex-classes~ list, and change the ~\\input~ path to your local customized clone of ~log-book-setup-2.tex~ file... You will need to study *LaTeX* a lot and in particular, the *"memoir"* document class... =read the well documented docs= /(see reference section below)/

Once you have tried this several times /(and failed)/ it won't look so complicated and you will begin to "get it"... /(Be Diligent! TeX/LaTeX IS a complicated Turing Complete Language... Created by one of the Geekiest GEEKS of Computer Science, Mathematics, and Algorithm Analysis! Donald Knuth... You have been warned!!!)/

=Good luck!=

=HOWTO: Prevent Headlines from Showing Up in the TOC=

Set any *HEADING* within your .org project file with the following PROPERTIES BOX...

- *Set The NOTOC Property:* /(NOT in TOC)/ 

     =* Section HEADING:=
     *:PROPERTIES:*
          ~:NOTOC: t~
     *:END:*
     Don't copy above.. /(it is formatted text)/... Create you own property's box.. LOL Read the docs... Not putting instructions for that here... Good Luck! Its easy... Actually... If you type the above /(as you see it rendered above)/ as naked text under any heading, THAT WILL WORK and you will see the text turn grey, confirming to you that org-mode sees and registers it...
