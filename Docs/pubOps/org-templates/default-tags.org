=YOU MAY REMOVE This Drawer= from your own clones of this template if it is bothering you... This drawer is only here as an aid for: HAP Modular Emacs DOC TEMPLATE housekeeping/updating tasks...

TAGS are a personal thing... Therefore MY Tags /(i.e., the DEFAULT TAGS that come out of box with Modular Emacs)/, will and should change to fit your personal use case... RENAME your copies of this file within your cloned org-templates directories within your projects... Change the tags to suit your needs... Make other TAG files like this for your different categories of projects etc... and include them in the .org files associated with that category... If you are doing all that, you will NOT want to update your Tag Files LATER to match any NEW tags used by DEFAULT Modular emacs...

*** FILE LOCAL TAGS: 

=15 Selection Keys ALREADY Used:= ~d f n o s x F H M W Y 2 3 + -~ 
/(the keys above are RESERVED for selecting GLOBAL TAGS)/
=Do NOT Duplicate the above keys for File Local Tags=

These TAGS are defined above at the TOP of this file... They will ONLY be available to org-mode files that include this tags setup file...  Keeping a limited set of flags for different kinds of files make it easier to assign them to headings within the file... HELM pops up choices in small space...

I am attempting to create my go-to *Controlled TAG Vocabulary* HERE as my set of *DEFAULT Tags* FIRST

This file will be included in ALL org-mode files starting out... Later when I find the need for adding specialized tags for org-files related to specialized categories, I will clone and alter this list creating a NEW specialized Tags File... /(i.e., creating NEW Tags, and removing Existing ones that won't be used in that category)/  =ALL NEW TAGS will be added to the CONTROLLED VOCABULARY Regardless=...  I DON'T want to end up with a controlled vocabulary of over 100 TAGS However... So Think Hard on this and hone a nice list of say 62 or so tags max...  These TAGS will be my *KM Workhorses*... Hoping they will be a big boost getting all that meta organization work done automatically and transparently in the background...

* TODO Defined TAG Shortcut KEYS:                      :noexport: 

=NOTE:= All of the keys below were assigned to DEFAULT TAGS that come out-of-box with HAP Modular Emacs... You most LIKELY will be changing ALL of those TAGS and the keys that select them... THE DEFAULT set of GLOBAL TAGS and their selection keys are found in ~09-2-org-keywords-tags-conf.el~ AND the File Local TAGS and selection keys are defined within this file /(i.e. the ones above and key lists below)/...

Since you will most likely be changing ALL Tags Global and File Local, the USED KEYS list below will have to change as well... and your Available Keys to use will also change... Hack Away! This is only a model for you to follow /(if you so choose)/... 

- *GLOBALLY DEFINED KEYS:* /(from 09-2-org-keywords-tags-conf.el)/ 
    /(DON'T USE THESE FOR FILE LOCAL - KEEP THIS LIST UPDATED. Change Keys Below if necessary)/

- *CURRENT KEYS - FREE to USE & DEFINE LOCALLY:*  
     /CHOOSE any of THESE FOR a NEW TAG to ADD ABOVE and then REMOVE it FROM THIS LIST)/ =NOTE:= this list will change if any of the keys in it are used above... KEEP IT UP TO DATE... If you make a COPY of this file (to use for OTHER Tags... The list below will let you know which selection keys are left and available to use... HOWEVER... caveat... If you copy this file and change the list below, you will need to update this same list within all your other tag files to keep them all in sync...





* Instructions:                                                  :noexport: 

This file is included as part of *Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs* to provide an example of how ~org-tags~ are organized by *Modular Emacs* as installed out-of-box on your machine... You should change FILE LOCAL tags HERE for your own purposes... These Tags fit my PIM/Knowledge Models... YMMV...

=NOTE:= In addition to *FILE LOCAL TAGS*... A set of *GLOBALLY defined TAGS* are available to ALL .org files opened within a HAP Modular Emacs configuration... You may and SHOULD change those global tags to fit your own personal categories of usage as well...

*GLOBAL TAGS* get assigned within: ~09-2-org-keywords-tags-conf.el~

- [ ] *USAGE:* [0/4] 
  
   /Follow These Steps to Use Out-Of-Box, or Customize with Your Own Tags.../

     - [ ] *COPY/CLONE:* ~~/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~ *Directory* 
            Copy it to your MASTER PROJECT directory where existing ~.org~ files reference this default-tags SETUPFILE... Modify the copied SETUP Files within your cloned org-templates directory to suit your needs... =NOTE:= Other instructions elsewhere within Modular Emacs may have gotten you to do this copy operation already... You Don't NEED to re-copy it again of course...

            =Don't Modify The MASTER Templates Within ~/.emacs.d=

            =VERIFY:= the following line in preamble heading of ~.Org~ Files includes this file... /(this is the default file name - which you could change to something else)/

             ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/default-tags.org~

             /Making a COPY/CLONE of:/ ~$HOME/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~ /master folder To your book's project directory will allow you to/         /make your own custom configurations for different projects without/ /affecting the configurations of other projects within their/ /own MASTER FOLDERS.../

     - [ ] *CONSULT the Defined TAG Shortcut KEYS Section Above:* 
           To see which TAG/KEY assignments are already set by default... BOTH Global and Local TAG/KEY assignment pairs are listed...

     - [ ] *ADD NEW LOCAL TAG/KEY Assignments:* 

            /(or modify existing LOCAL assignments)/

            HERE you may /(and should)/ modify or Replace any of the FILE LOCAL TAG/KEY assignments to create your own custom ~xxx-tags.org~ SETUPFILE...

            You may ADD NEW or Change any of the FILE LOCAL tags and key assignments to fit your categorical needs...

            =CONSULT:= the *CURRENT KEYS - FREE to USE & DEFINE LOCALLY:* list to see which key assignments are free and available to make... If you make changes, update this list as well as the *FILE LOCAL DEFINED KEYS:* list...

            Realize some of the already defined FILE LOCAL TAGS are of a General and USEFUL Nature for most use-cases that you may not want to change...
   
            Therefore those general purpose tags should probably be left as is..., or at least, assign NEW shortcut KEYs to them. /(if you have a better TAG in mind, by all means use it!)/

     - [ ] *CHANGE GLOBALLY DEFINED TAG/KEY Assignments:*  

            The GLOBALLY DEFINED Shortcut KEYS Assign TAGS for =ALL .ORG FILES= Globally... These TAGS are defined within: ~09-2-org-keywords-tags-conf.el~

            These keys are conveniently listed for your inspection under: the *GLOBALLY DEFINED KEYS* list above.. You CAN and probably SHOULD change these GLOBAL TAGS and their selection keys defined within: ~09-2-org-keywords-tags-conf.el~. In that case, ALL the TAG selection keys listed above will need to be updated to reflect your changes...

            Be careful NOT to assign the same selection "key" to two different tags (global or local) IF you do that the TAG selection for that key will be broken...
