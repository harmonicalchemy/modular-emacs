This file is included as part of *Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs* to provide an example of how ~org-tags~ are organized by *Modular Emacs* as installed out-of-box
on your machine... You can change FILE LOCAL tags HERE for your own purposes...

=NOTE:= In addition to *FILE LOCAL TAGS*... A set of *GLOBALLY defined TAGS*
      are available to ALL .org files opened within a HAP Modular Emacs
      configuration...
      
      *GLOBAL TAGS* get assigned within: ~09-2-org-keywords-tags-conf.el~

- [ ] *USAGE:* [0/4]
  
   /Follow These Steps to Use Out-Of-Box, or Customize with Your Own Tags.../

   + [ ] *COPY/CLONE:* ~~/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~ directory
          to your MASTER PROJECT directory where existing ~.org~ files reference
          this contained default-tags SETUPFILE... Modify the copied SETUP
          Files within your cloned org-templates directory to suit your needs...

          =Don't Modify The MASTER Templates Within ~/.emacs.d=

          =VERIFY:= the following line in preamble heading of ~.Org~ Files
          includes this file...
          /(this is the default - which you could change to something else)/

              ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/default-tags.org~

      /Making a COPY/CLONE of:/ ~$HOME/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~
      /master folder To your book's project directory will allow you to/
      /make your own custom configurations for different books without/
      /affecting the configurations of other book projects within their/
      /own MASTER FOLDERS.../

   + [ ] =CONSULT:= the =Defined TAG Shortcut KEYS:= Section to see which TAG/KEY
         assignments are already set by default... BOTH Global and Local TAG/KEY
         assignment pairs are listed...

   + [ ] =ADD NEW LOCAL TAG/KEY Assignments:=

          /(or modify existing LOCAL assignments)/

          HERE you may /(if you need)/ modify or Replace any of the FILE LOCAL
          TAG/KEY assignments to create your own custom ~xxx-tags.org~
          SETUPFILE...

          You may ADD NEW or Change any of the FILE LOCAL tags and key
          assignments to fit your categorical needs...

          =CONSULT:= the *CURRENT KEYS - FREE to USE & DEFINE LOCALLY:* list to
                   see which key assignments are free and available to make...
                   If you make changes, update this list as well as the
                   *FILE LOCAL DEFINED KEYS:* list...

          Realize some of the already defined FILE LOCAL TAGS are of a General
          and USEFUL Nature for most use-cases that you may not want to change...
   
          Therefore those general purpose tags /(e.g., must_read, etc.,)/ should
          probably be left as is..., or at least, assign NEW shortcut KEYs to them.
          /(if you have a better TAG in mind that fits that particular keyboard KEY
           better than it does to the existing default TAG assignment)/

   + [ ] =DO NOT MODIFY ANY GLOBALLY DEFINED Shortcht TAG/KEY Assignments=

          The GLOBALLY DEFINED Shortcut KEYS Assign TAGS for =ALL .ORG FILES=
          Globally... These TAGS are defined within:
      
             ~09-2-org-keywords-tags-conf.el~

          These keys are conveniently listed for your inspection under:
          the *GLOBALLY DEFINED KEYS* list above...
        
          =You CANNOT use these KEYS to define FILE LOCAL TAGS!=

          /(If you try, your KEY choices will be SHADOWED by DEFAULTS/
           /and will not work)/
