:LATEST_UPDATE: 
=Last Updated:= <2025-03-24 Mon> 

=YOU MAY REMOVE This Drawer= from your own clones of this template if it is bothering you... This drawer is used for HAP Modular Emacs DOC TEMPLATES housekeeping...

=HOWEVER= you may also use it for the same purpose to keep your existing Modular Emacs based org documents in sync with the latest updates of the template they were created from...
  
=If you do wish to do the same... Read On Below...=
  
- =INTERNAL USE Instructions:= /(END USERS SKIP THIS BULLET)/ 

    This bullet is not for end users... This is /"Note to Self"/ stuff...

     - [X] =MASTER TEMPLATE ONLY= *Keep The Above Timestamp Up To Date:* 

         *DO THIS ALWAYS*, JUST AFTER YOU UPDATE THIS SETUPFILE...
         =DON'T FORGET!=

- =PUBLIC USE Instructions:= /(FOR CLONES OF THIS TEMPLATE)/ 

     - [ ] =Change this= *:LATEST_UPDATE:* =drawer title:= /(within clones only)/ 

          Change it to: *:LATEST_TEMPLATE_UPDATE:* within NEWLY CREATED CLONES...

     - [ ] *COMPARE the TIMESTAMPS between THIS TEMPLATE and CLONES:* 

          ~Org-Mode~ and ~AuxTeX~ settings and meta data within CLONES of
          this SETUPFILE TEMPLATE will get out of sync after a while due
          to Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs version updates etc...
        
          Use the ABOVE timestamp /(within the TEMPLATE and your CLONE)/
          to see if the clone's settings need to be updated...
          /(i.e., brought into sync with its template - MERGE)/ and then
          perform any needed merging/replacing of BOILERPLATE and/or
          meta data. /(e.g, *:README:* drawers, etc.)/

     - [ ] *Keep ABOVE timestamp within CLONES of this template UP TO DATE:* 

          =AFTER Completing Above MERGE Step= and your clone has been brought
          up to date /(i.e. in sync)/ with its STARTUPFILE TEMPLATE...
          Then update the timestamp ABOVE... /(WITHIN YOUR CLONE)/ to record
          the date of its last sync status...

=Usage:= *Copy/Clone* this file and adjust to suit your needs... *Include* this SETUPFILE within ~.org~ files destined to become a *Short General Purpose Document*...

*COPY/CLONE:* ~~/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~ directory to the MASTER directory where existing .org files reference this contained SETUPFILE... Modify the copied SETUP Files within your cloned org-templates directory to suit your needs...

=Don't Modify The MASTER Templates Within ~/.emacs.d=

/(if you did by accident, you can easily enough perform:/
       
   ~git restore <this file>~
   =or:= ~git checkout .~

/to refresh ALL since you are not modifying the master branch...)/

=Add:= The following line to the Header of ~.Org~ Files that need to include this file: 

   ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/pdf-excerpt-setup.org~ 

/Making a COPY/CLONE of:/ ~$HOME/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~ /master folder To your book's project directory will allow you to make your own custom configurations for different books or other docs, without affecting the configurations of other book projects within their own MASTER FOLDERS.../

=NOTE:= The Configurations within this file depend on Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs init file: ~~/.emacs.d/lisp/modules/09-4-org-export-conf.el~...

If you need to create other LaTeX Document Styles or customize existing ones, you will also need to override ~09-4-org-export-conf.el~ by placing a copy of it within: ~~/.emacs.d/lisp/my-modules~ and then make your changes in your cloned copy...

Find the: ~BEGIN: CUSTOM LaTeX CONFIGURATIONS for EXPORT to PDF~ heading within that file... You can modify or add new configurations and even ~\\input~ external LaTeX files with even more fancy modifications... It's a LOT of work, /(research)/ but worth it in the end when you have something looking really nice!

=This configuration uses the EXCERPT DOCUMENT CLASS= defined within: 
~09-4-org-export-conf.el~ as: ~excerpt~ for its *LaTeX* Configuration...

=For Local Customizing:= EVERYTHING is pretty much done in this Setup File now... Only the generic things common to all LaTeX export configurations are done in Emacs Lisp configurations... Only the names are added to the list so the dispatcher knows what to do...

However if you are curious to see how things work, Find the ~"excerpt"~ section within ~org-latex-classes~ list, The UGLY Lisp/LaTeX mongrel code starts after the first ~\\~ Indicating the beginning of *LaTeX* directives that have to be escaped within an eLisp list...

I hated that so I PUT as MUCH of the LaTeX configurations here in this .ORG file... Much cleaner IMHO and ALSO Portable as well... This is the Best Practice for Emacs to LaTeX to PDF Folks! Hands Down...  /(and it follows well Knuth's original idea of literate programming - which this writer-programmer loves! %^)/...

I mean... I can write stories /(oh yeah)/ and have fun while coding, /(while also doing code documenting which is what I should be doing)/ LOL...

I digress... The Fact is plain though... Mixing both languages /(eLisp & LaTeX)/ together is an =insult to both languages mutually...= =IMHO=  So as you see I Limited this to bare necessities only... /(which is acceptable "glue" otherwise how can the dispatcher know?)/

Once you have tried this several times to customize your LaTeX /(and failed)/ it won't look so complicated and you will begin to "get it"  Everything can be done here, no need to go out and search through you lisp configurations...

/(BE DILIGENT little grasshopper! TeX/LaTeX IS a complicated Turing Complete Language... Created by one of the Geekiest GEEKS of Computer Science, Mathematics, and Algorithm Analysis! Donald Knuth... You have been warned!!!)/

But your woes are right inside this file only... /(and the LaTeX docs, and Libraries of course)/

=Good luck!=

=HERE ARE A FEW Org-Mode LaTeX Tips:= /(I may add a few more here as I find them, i.e., if I find them to be common hurdles/caveats for most folks)/

- Prevent Headlines from Showing Up in the *TOC* 

   Set any *HEADING* within your ~.org~ project file with the following *:PROPERTIES:* BOX...

     + *Set The NOTOC Property:* /(NOT in TOC)/

          ~*~ =ANY Section HEADING:=
          *:PROPERTIES:*
          :       :NOTOC: t
          *:END:*
          Don't copy this pretty text example... It is NOT code... LOL
