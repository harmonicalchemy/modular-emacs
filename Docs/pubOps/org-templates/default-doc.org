:LATEST_UPDATE:
  =Last Updated:= <2023-02-18 Sat> /(this template needs work)/

  =YOU MAY REMOVE This Drawer= from your own clones of this template if
  it is bothering you... This drawer is used for HAP Modular Emacs
  DOC TEMPLATES housekeeping...

  =HOWEVER= you may also use it for the same purpose to keep your existing
  Modular Emacs based org documents in sync with the latest updates of the
  template they were created from...
  
  =If you do wish to do the same... Read On Below...=
  
  - =INTERNAL USE Instructions:= /(END USERS SKIP THIS BULLET)/

    This bullet is not for end users... This is /"Note to Self"/ stuff...

    + [ ] =MASTER TEMPLATE ONLY= *Keep The Above Timestamp Up To Date:*

        *DO THIS ALWAYS*, JUST AFTER YOU UPDATE THIS SETUPFILE...
        =DON'T FORGET!=

  - =PUBLIC USE Instructions:= /(FOR CLONES OF THIS TEMPLATE)/

    + [ ] =Change this= *:LATEST_UPDATE:* =drawer title:= /(within clones only)/

         Change it to: *:LATEST_TEMPLATE_UPDATE:* within NEWLY CREATED CLONES...

    + [ ] *COMPARE the TIMESTAMPS between THIS TEMPLATE and CLONES:*

         ~Org-Mode~ and ~AuxTeX~ settings and meta data within CLONES of
         this SETUPFILE TEMPLATE will get out of sync after a while due
         to Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs version updates etc...
        
         Use the ABOVE timestamp /(within the TEMPLATE and your CLONE)/
         to see if the clone's settings need to be updated...
         /(i.e., brought into sync with its template - MERGE)/ and then
         perform any needed merging/replacing of BOILERPLATE and/or
         meta data. /(e.g, *:README:* drawers, etc.)/

    + [ ] *Keep ABOVE timestamp within CLONES of this template UP TO DATE:*

         =AFTER Completing Above MERGE Step= and your clone has been brought
         up to date /(i.e. in sync)/ with its STARTUPFILE TEMPLATE...
         Then update the timestamp ABOVE... /(WITHIN YOUR CLONE)/ to record
         the date of its last sync status...
