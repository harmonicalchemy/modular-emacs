(DIRECT - NOW WITH DR. JEZNIK AT OPEN IRON DOOR)
(GASPS) What's all the fuss about that big old iron hatch which used to open into what used to be the basement access to the Lighthouse?  Why are you trying to open it? There's nothing but thick vines and blackberry canes all overgrown over the top of this broken Lighthouse base and it's for sure to be a tangled mess on the other side of that door as well!  We can crawl around to the other side where the entire wall is missing and I will show you!

DR. JEZNIK

Don't worry Peter, you will see shortly... There are no vines... Now help me open this heavy door!

(TO DR. JEZNIK - PARTIALLY REVERBRATED BY CHAMBER BEYOND DOOR)
Hey!  What's all that mist blocking the opening?  I would call it sea fog but it looks much thicker and iridescent cobalt blue?  I am also feeling an uncomfortable prickly feeling... (PAUSE) ([SFX-06] FOOTSTEPS AS PETER BACKS AWAY FROM DOOR)
(NERVOUSLY) Yikes!  Dr. J ... Um... the hair on my arm went all static electricity like until I let go of that door!  That fog feels tingly and very thick and sticky!  I don't feel good about this!  (GASP) What's Happening?

DR. JEZNIK
(TO PETER - PARTIALLY REVERBRATED BY CHAMBER BEYOND DOOR)
Hold fast to my hand boy!  We need to be grounded before coming in contact with the event horizon... I am putting my right hand through now...  Just stay close behind me and you will be fine...
