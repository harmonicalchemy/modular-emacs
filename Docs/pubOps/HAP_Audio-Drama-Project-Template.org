#+DESCRIPTION: HAP Audio Theatre Project Skeleton. Great for Authors to use when starting a new Radio Drama, Podcast, News Program, or any kind of Audio-Only Production project...

* ⚒ setup-config:                                            :noexport: 

:READ_ME_FIRST: 

☞ =Instructions:= /(How to Install & Use This Template)/ 

To use *HAP_Audio-Drama-Project-Template.Org* /(Org-Mode Audio Drama Project Skeleton /Template)/ for your own projects, =Perform The Following Steps:= 

/Use the org-mode Checkboxes to Help You Keep Track of Progress/

1) [ ] *CREATE a NEW:* ~.../Audio-Drama/?/~  *Project Folder:* /(for your Audio Drama)/ 

        Create a NEW folder as your ="NEW-Audio-Project"= folder...
        Give it a name that makes sense for the entire thing... All sub components
        of your Audio Drama will be kept within this PARENT PROJECT FOLDER

2) [ ] *Copy the* ~./media~ *Directory to Your Project Folder:* 

         The media directory exists within the same pubOps folder as this Template...
         Copy the media dir and ALL of its contents to your NEW Audio Drama Project
         Folder...

         Any external documents or images referenced by your audio project should be
         placed within this ~./media/~ directory... This single ~./media~ directory will
         serve media and external attachments for this and any other extra audio drama
         ~.org~ files you may end up creating here, as well as being the media repository
         used by LaTeX during publishing... You will also be using this ~./media/~
         directory to store finished sound media, /(e.g., sound-effects, loops,
    music, etc.)/ that are called out within the cue sheets /(also contained
    within this ~.org~ project)/ 

         This ~./media/~ directory may ALSO contain a SymLink to the media folder
         used by a =DAW Project= for =post production work= directly related to this 
         Audio Drama Project...

         Media required for use in template BOILERPLATE Sections already exists within
         this folder /(for HAP Audio Project Template .org files)/
         So that is all set...

3) [ ] *Copy the* ~./org-templates~ *Directory to Your Project Folder:* 

         The org-templates directory exists within the same pubOps folder as this Template...
         Copy the org-templates dir and ALL of its contents to your NEW Audio Drama Project
         Folder...

         This folder contains all of the "behind-the-scenes" files needed by THIS Template file
         in order to be able to publish to PDF files as well as process the open standard
         fountain drama script to produce Properly Formatted printed Scripts for Audio Only
         Theater, Drama, News, what ever ...i.e. lighting cues etc. are not present...

     - *Purpose of the:* ~./org-templates~  *Directory:*

        The files in here are automatically linked and included within this
        template. You don't need to change those settings unless you wish to
        customize the already customized tags, and export options.

        /Things are currently set up correctly for the audio drama genre, and/
        /the category is all set as well... But you can and may modify/
        ~audio-book-setup.org~ /to narrow down the category more/
        /specifically, fitting everything to this project's specific/
        /needs.../

        In addition there may also be an ~audio-book-setup.tex~ file in this
        directory, which MAY be needed for more extensive LaTeX Styling...
        If this file is present, read the Instrutions within it for more
        info on what to do... 

        The DEFAULT Tags defined for all project templates are useful for
        most situations and SOME tags are ALWAYS to be defined for this
        LaTeX publishing system to work.

        /Change the SETUPFILE name ABOVE and within this directory from/
        ~default-tags.org~ /to another name and-or replace some -BUT NOT ALL-/
        /of the tags within to your own tags... see instructions inside the/
        /file.../

4) [ ] *Other Directories are AUTO Created* /(don't copy these to your project)/ 

     - *Purpose of the:* ~./auto/~ *Directory:* 

          This is where output ~.PDF~ files will be placed during export. This folder is auto
          generated during org-mode LaTeX processing... It will also appear within your
          project folder after you perform an EXPORT process...

          LaTeX processing will not delete any prior files contained here... Some of them
          will be updated, but will have backups...  Any files you place within this folder
          will NOT be lost, unless you delete them...

          This "auto" folder /(after it first appears from an export process)/
          is a good place to store other temporary files you may be creating, generating...
          For that matter, you could create and use this folder within your own project
          ahead of time, to use for your own purposes... Later... LaTeX processing will find
          and use your auto folder as well...

     - *The www folder is for future web pub development* 

         Don't copy this folder to your project.  It is not used... FUTURE Plans are to use that
         folder for auto-publishing to the web via git...

2) [ ] =Start Sketching Out Your Story NOW Before You Loose It!= 

      =NOTE:= You may be doing this because you have some fantastic story idea brewing
                    in your mind and you need to write that down before you forget!  =Right?=
                    Therefore... as soon as you clone this file, =STOP= and go immediately to the:

                    ~💡 Scratchpad Refile Binder~ 

             =READ ALL OF THE INFORMATION= UNDER The *☞ Start Here!* heading and
             follow the instructions...
             
             =Write your idea down quickly= /(as per the instructions)/ 
             to get your inspiration recorded before you forget it...

             Later, After you have all your ideas sketched out and you are ready to be in an
             ="organized mood"= rather than creative mood /(This does not imply
     being organized cannot be a CREATIVE PROCESS)/
             *Then it is time to:*

             =Come Back Here And Finish Setting Up Your Project...=

             *This Project Template is HUGE!*

             *Your Muse Can Easily Loose Her Inspiration!*

             =The ☞ Start Here Section is Your Remedy= 

             =Do That first!=

3) [ ] *FINISH SETTING UP THIS PROJECT...* [0/10] 

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TITLE:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

           Change it to /"Your Audio Drama Project's Title"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+SUBTITLE:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

           Change it to /"Your Audio Drama Project's Sub Title"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

           Also change this directive to: /"Your-Audio-Drama-Project's-Title.pdf"/ 
           That will be the file name(s) produced during export thence forward
           /(including auto generated files: .tex, etc...)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Copyright © 2022:~ *directive top of this file:* 

          Change to: /"Copyright © your info here"/ You are the copyright
          owner of your own documents created from clones of these master
          templates... /(but these MASTER Template Files are to stay under/
          /Harmonic Alchemy Productions copyright. Any Attribution to me/
          /for the template structure of your published docs will be/
          /appreciated... but unnecessary... Thanks! ;-)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+AUTHOR:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

          Change to: /"your NAME"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+EMAIL:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

          Change to: /"your EMAIL"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Created:~ *TIMESTAMP at the top of this file:* 

          Put your cursor on the TIMESTAMP: /i.e.,/ <2022-10-05 Wed>
          and type: ~C-c . . RETURN~ The TIMESTAMP will update to NOW.

          =LEAVE THIS DATE ALONE after Setting It The FIRST Time=

          This Date reflects the time/date that you first created this
          new document It should NEVER change after that...

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Last Published:~ *TIMESTAMP at Publish Time:* 

          =Don't Change This UNTIL You Have Actually Exported This File=
          /(as a PDF or HTML, etc. and have PUBLISHED it publically somewhere)/

          Until that publishing time comes leave it alone as: <not-published>
          
          As soon as this is published or re-published, Replace the
          <unpublished> placeholder with a REAL TIMESTAMP by typing:
          ~C-c . . RETURN~ The new Last Published: <TIMESTAMP> will
          appear in place... Do this EVERY time you publish or update
          an existing publishing... /(this will help you keep track)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+FILETAGS:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

          Add your own tags that match the context of your Audio Production...

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+DESCRIPTION:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

           Compose /Your-Audio-Drama-Project's Description/ as a short 
           paragraph here... and then use that to change the directive
           above in the File HEADER...

4) [ ] =Ongoing Planning / Writing - Developing Your Audio Production:= 

      /Change headings and structure to match your project's outline episodes-scenes-plots-characters, etc./ 

      *Start doing the Tasks within the Tasks section:*

      =Have fun doing this...=

5) [ ] =Export/Publish to PDF File:= 

      The *In-Buffer Settings* specified by the SETUPFILES above will 
      get this file looking good when exported as a Standard PDF file.  
      Once you have your project directory all set up as above you are 
      ready to export your first PDF as a test run...

         *Issue the following Emacs command:*

            ~M-x org-latex-export-to-pdf~

         *OR* If You Enabled *Xah-Fly-Keys* /"Command Mode"/ Try Shortcut:

            ~SPACE e p~

         *OR Export to OTHER Formats:*

            ~C-c C-e~

            /(a pop-up will show allowing you to choose export method)/

      After *AucTeX* is done parsing/compiling etc., a new *PDF* by the name of:
      ~My-New-Audio-Drama.pdf~ -and- ~My-New-Audio-Drama.tex~ will appear 
      within this project's directory...

      Subsequent repeated calls to the above command will overwrite your existing
      ~My-New-Audio-Drama.pdf~ -and- ~My-New-Audio-Drama.tex~ files!
      /(make backups first if needed!)/
      You should probably copy these files to the ~./auto/~ directory as 
      well for safe keeping as backups...

      =If you chose the last option above= LaTeX will output files with other
      extensions for those other output formats...

      =NOTE:= SETUPFILES have not been created yet for other eBook formats.
             /(This is a work in progress)/

      =If YOU EXPERIENCE LaTeX ERRORS:= 

         *Consult Buffer:* ~*Org PDF LaTeX Output*~

6) [ ] =Handling Images= 

      Some Images may render too large or too small to fit on a page
      of an exported version of this file... This is easy do fix within
      your content on an image by image basis...
      
      Use *LaTeX* and/or *HTML* attributes as follows on the images that need
      to be a different size...

      =Example:=
      
         #+CAPTION: Example: Larger Size Emoji 
         #+NAME:  example:00001
         #+attr_html: :width 200px
         #+attr_latex: :width 200px
      [[~/.emacs.d/lisp/my-modules/emojis/Dabolus-Complete-Emoji-Collection/u1F3D5.png]]

      =To TOGGLE Inline Images ON and OFF:=

      *Use:* ~C-c C-x C-v~ /(org-toggle-inline-images)/
  
      Toggle the inline display of linked images. When called with a prefix argument,
      also display images that do have a link description. You can ask for inline images
      to be displayed at startup by configuring the variable org-startup- with-inline-images .


=These Instructions Were Last Modified:= <2024-10-13 Sun> 

So far things are pretty basic PDF which is good enough for Audio Production... /(i.e., I'm still chasing LaTeX errors)/

Your Printed output will not be a normal book, more like a manual containing everything you need to produce an full fledged audio production...

=Please Open an ISSUE At:= https://github.com/harmonicalchemy/modular-emacs/issues
   
Please use Issues to Ask Questions, Report Problems/Bugs etc., and Suggest Ideas for Improvement...
=You guys are my Product Managers=  I am only a User of ONE "seat".  Other folks UX metrics are sorely needed!! Thanks!

:LATEST_UPDATE: 
  <2025-06-22 Sun>

  =YOU MAY REMOVE This Drawer= from your own clones of this template if
  it is bothering you... This drawer is used for HAP Modular Emacs
  DOC TEMPLATES housekeeping...

  =HOWEVER= you may also use it for the same purpose to keep your existing
  Modular Emacs based org documents in sync with the latest updates of the
  template they were created from...
  
  =If you do wish to do the same... Read On Below...=
  
  - =INTERNAL USE Instructions:= /(END USERS SKIP THIS BULLET)/ 

    This bullet is not for end users... This is /"Note to Self"/ stuff...

      + [X] =MASTER TEMPLATE ONLY= *Keep The Above Timestamp Up To Date:* 

          DO THIS ALWAYS, JUST AFTER YOU UPDATE THIS TEMPLATE... DON'T FORGET!
          /(i.e., BOILERPLATE content and :README: meta data)/
  
  - =PUBLIC USE Instructions:= /(FOR CLONES OF THIS TEMPLATE)/ 

      + [ ] *FOR NEWLY CREATED CLONES:* 

          - [ ] =Change this= *:LATEST_UPDATE:* =drawer title:= /(within clones only)/ 

               Change it to: *:LATEST_TEMPLATE_UPDATE:*

          - [ ] *REMOVE INTERNAL USE INSTRUCTIONS* 

               Remove the main =INTERNAL USE Instructions:= bullet above...
               That bullet is only relevant to the TEMPLATE, /(not clones)/

      + [ ] *FOR ALREADY EXISTING PROJECTS*: 

          - [ ] *COMPARE the TIMESTAMPS between THIS TEMPLATE and your PROJECT:* 

              The BOILERPLATE content and meta data within CLONES of this
              TEMPLATE will get out of sync after a while due to Harmonic
              Alchemy Modular Emacs version updates etc... Some NEW features
              or HEADINGS may have been added that make sense to be added
              to your existing project /(originally a clone of this)/
        
              Use the ABOVE timestamp /(within the TEMPLATE and your CLONE)/
              to see if the clone's BOILERPLATE content needs to be updated
              /(brought into sync with its template - MERGE)/ and then perform
              any needed merging/replacing of BOILERPLATE and/or meta data.
              /(e.g, *:README:* drawers, etc. even this drawer)/

          - [ ] *Keep ABOVE timestamp within CLONES of this template UP TO DATE:* 

              =AFTER Completing Above MERGE Step= and your clone's BOILERPLATE
              content has been brought up to date /(i.e. in sync)/ with its
              TEMPLATE... Then update the timestamp ABOVE... /(WITHIN YOUR CLONE)/
              to record the date of its last sync status...

:END:
:SETUP-README: 

 =Setup Files:=

   For Cloned Versions of this template, the file/paths below will be relative
   to your parent project directory and as such, should be all set to your new: ~.../your-audio-drama-production-project/org-templates/~ directory...

 =NOTE:= 

   ~#+CATEGORY:~ is specified within ~audio-book-setup.org~ SETUPFILE.
   If you need to change the category, do it within your cloned version
   of: audio-book-setup.org...

   *SETUPFILE:* ~audio-book-setup.org~ is for LaTeX Export Configurations 
              to produce your Project as a kind of Reference Manual or
              Production Manual, and also the raw source of all your
              Writing... For review as a printable PDF file...

   *SETUPFILE:* ~audio-tags.org~ is where tags are defined for this project.

              The Existing Tags are useful for most situations within
              this context, and some of the tags MUST ALWAYS be defined
              for this LaTeX publishing system to work correctly...
              
              This file may be used by other ~.org~ files within this
              Master Folder... If you need to customize them specifically
              for this ~.org~ file alone, you should copy and rename:
              ~audio-tags.org~ and modify your renamed copy instead...
              
              If you do this, you will ALSO need to change the
              ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/audio-tags.org~
              directive below to reflect your changed file name...

              /(change the name from/ ~audio-tags.org~ /to another name/
              /and-or replace some (but NOT ALL) of the tags within/
              /to your own tags... see instructions inside the file)/

   *SETUPFILE:* ~awc-config.json~ is for configuration of FINAL DRAFT
              *Fountain Scripts* to convert them to *PDF files* suitable
              for printing and using during rehearsals and performances

* NEW 💡 Scratchpad Refile:                                  :noexport: 
** ☞ Start Here! 

This Section is mainly to accommodate "seat-of-pants" writers /(Of Which I Have Been Accused Of... But I Also Crave The Planning Stuff)/. 

I often come here for my [[https://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html]["yak shaving"]] adventures...

Use this: "*💡 Scratchpad Refile*" section as a quick place to document ideas and inspirations as they come along... You can refile them later... 

Even if your quick inspiration was intended for elsewhere?, /(e.g., You become bored documenting tedious technical information when suddenly, out-of-nowhere, an idea for a new sci-fi scene in that screenplay episode you had in the back of your mind all day!, etc.)/

=Ummm.... Parallel Universe?= - =Sure!= You can put anything in here! We've got that covered for you in this Start Here spot. %^)

Use this section to quickly capture inspired at-the-moment ideas...
=While they are still fresh in mind=

=How To Use ???= 

/Simply Come directly here and do what ever you want.../
/"Your Crazy Daze are Covered!" Yay!/ 

=The following Shortcuts= will Help you get started as quickly as possible.
/(using Knowledge Management Best Practices)/ and templates designed to help you sketch up ideas focused on Audio Drama Projects.  A basic bare bones IDEAs Template is also provided for you to use and design for any purpose of any scope!

- =NEW SCENE Shortcut:=  /Use This If You Have A New Scene Idea/ 

     - [ ] =Copy/Clone:= *NEW 🎙* ~S???~ <2022-09-09 Fri> *Scene Title:* 

              From: *💡 New Scene Ideas:* Below...

              =Copy the Template's Heading AND ALL ITS CONTENTS= 

              Place your Clone Directly ABOVE the NEW Scene Template
              from which it was copied...

              Change your Clone's Title to Your Own Title...

     - [ ] *Change the timestamp on your Clone Entry:* [0/1] 

           =Type:= ~C-c .~ while cursor is sitting on the timestamp

           /i.e., Press: ~Ctrl-c~, let go, and then type a Period/ ~.~

           A date chooser panel will pop up...

          - [ ] *Press* ~ENTER~ *to auto accept today's date and time.*  

                  The existing timestamp will change to TODAY...
                  Leave the timestamp at this date for the duration
                  it is a record of when this new scene Idea first
                  got into your head...

     - [ ] *Start Writing!!!* 

            Fill in Location Details, Write a Quick Summary, or simply 
            begin writhing dialog under the *📃 Fountain Script:* 
            heading...

     - [ ] *Don't stop Writing!* 

            Don't worry about formatting or organizing it until later, 
            after all your inspiration has passed and you are ready 
            to organize...

            However without breaking your focus, you should add relevant
            ~:org_tags:~ that come to mind as you are writing...

            This is easy to do... Simply Type: ~C-c C-q~ Add Your Tag
            and =THEN CONTINUE WRITING...=

            Adding =TAGS= is a =VITAL KM BEST PRACTICE FIRST STEP=
            which will help you find important things you have written
            by the seat-of-your-pants, LATER LONG After you may have
            forgotten!  /(better than Google Search)/ :trollface:

     - [ ] =TODO After You Are Done Writing:= 

          - [ ] *Move this new Scene Idea into an existing Episode:* 

               =MOVE= this Scene Idea /(structured as it is)/ below to
               an already existing *🎙 Episode* within the *🎙 Production:*
               Binder of this Project... 

               The Org-Mode Outline Level of your clone is all set to 
               fit perfectly under an existing *🎙 Episode* Heading...

               =OR CREATE a Brand New Episode= for this New Scene 
               instead... 

               /(It may even be the start of an entirely NEW Series!)/

          - [ ] *Continue Writing/Developing RIGHT HERE if needed:* 

                If you are not yet sure where this new Scene should go
                AND you are still inspired to write... Simply continue
                writing and developing this scene in place RIGHT HERE...

                =ONE IMPORTANT Point:= It is Good KM Practice to continue
                adding relevant org-tags to this item right NOW before you
                forget...

                You may not know where things belong in the beginning but
                you most likely DO Know the category, genra, etc. of your
                new idea...

** <2022-10-23 Sun> Personal Escape Pod (PEP): /(template)/ 

I thought about this plot device idea that could be useful in a sci-fi setting...

- =For example:= 

    Explorers are venturing into unknown and probably dangerous territory somewhere in the universe...

    For their expeditions, explorers are issued a pack of supplies to help them collect data, do field research, and deal with the environments they visit in case they find themselves in a hostile situation /(which always happens)/...

    One of the devices included with each explorer's personal packs is called a PEP.  (personal escape pod)... This is a small round orb thing that is kept in a protective shielded box...   When the box is opened the orb instantly expands around the person and transports them to a safe (virtual location outside of known space) via bending space and creating some sort of quantum field or something which contains the person who opened the box... i.e., a combination transporter and virtual safe house kind of thing...

    When personnel are out on a mission exposed in the field, the small box containing the PEP orb can be worn around the neck, /(small enough to be worn on the same chain as one's dog tags)/ The orb box measures only 2x2x5 inches and sits nicely when worn over the heart...

    Given an emergency, it is easy to slap the box containing the orb with your right hand, while simultaneously uttering a secret command /(vocal)/, or forming a symbol /(made with finger over the face of the box)/, and then tapping three times to authenticate and confirm...

    This causes the box to instantly open exposing the glowing orb inslde... Once the orb is exposed, an invisible force field envelopes the wearer providing total protection from all outside the field, /(which does not exist within the orb's weird space time continuum)/

- =Update Later in the evening:= <2022-10-23 Sun> 

    *Quantum Cloning Pod:* /(QCP)/ 

    A QCP is a variant of the PEP device... When one of these QCP boxes is opened the orb instantly expands around the person but INSTEAD of transporting the person, to a virtual location outside of known space, an exact COPY or CLONE of the occupent instantly appears within "weird space"...  When the original person exits the orb's field, the clone teleports into the orb field replacing the original person who has exited. Once the clone fully occupies the field, the field collapses back into the orb and the box automatically closes...

    At this point there exist two exact copies of the person, their clone being exactly the same with all the same memories etc...

This is a dummy example of some crazy idea that you may have gotten at the spur of the moment, while you were doing something elsewhere within this project...  After you are done getting as much of the idea as you initially can then you can simply go back to what you were doing before the inspiration segue tore you away... You might want to schedule this as a todo item before leaving though...

This is the start of an essay comparing gourmet chefs, music composers, producers, architects, authors, and software developers...

Although the above disciplines don't seem to have much in common at first glance... A deeper analysis may reveal a generalized trend of significant similar attributes and processes in common across all of the above mentioned groups... A generalized trend may be revealed that leads to great success in each related field...

It is my hope that this study will reveal these common trends...

A research discussion will be proposed to investigate the how each group goes about doing the things they do, the way they do it, and why...  That will be the first step...

More to come later...  Hope this is enough kindling to start the fire...

:README: 
Here is the =ULTIMATE MASTER WORKSPACE= for creating, developing, and  updating a *new scene*...

All ideas, plots, dialog, sounds, music, production notes, etc. for a particular scene within this episode are developed here solely...

One of the accompanying fountain drama scripts for this *Audio Drama Project* ~.org~ file /(named after this episode)/ contains a compilation of all the /fountain script snippits/ for all scenes developed within this single episode...

Some elements created here will become part of the accompanying fountain drama script for this episode... /(e.g., dialog, notes, narration, etc.)/ 

The accompanying fountain drama script for this episode must be kept up to date with final drafts and latest edits made solely here...

The headings within this ~.org~ file can be tracked using ~GTD~ tags, and a *log* entry can keep track of time worked on them... Once a scene is in final draft stage, it can be marked *DONE* and the fountain script for the episode will be updated to reflect that scene's final draft state...

*What is a Scene?*

Scenes form the fabric within episodes of audio or radio programs...

Scenes are small packages of isolated events relating to a single unique thread/picture knitted into a defined situation where particular events related to that situation play out...

The scenes don't necessarily follow in chronological order but they relate to each other in the mosaic fabric of the story as it develops... 

If a scene changes abruptly to some other situation, that may mean that the scene is over and a new one is starting... Usually a change of environment triggers a new scene...

** NEW 💡 <2020-06-07 Sun> Visisonar Object /(Asimov's Foundation Series)/ 
:README: 
This is a dummy example of some crazy idea that you may have gotten at the spur of the moment, while you were doing something elsewhere within this project...  After you are done getting as much of the idea as you initally can then you can simply go back to what you were doing before the inspiration segue tore you away...

:END:

From Isaac Asimov's science fiction series 'Foundation', specifically the section of 'Foundation and Empire' entitled 'The Mule', the visisonar is considered a musical instrument.

Unlike most instruments, this one does not achieve its effect by using sonic effects but, instead, directly stimulates the listeners' mental well-being. The number of people and level of effect depends on the skill level of the player. As this was a device from the First Empire, there were not that many people around with any skill at all. However, the Mule's clown, Magnifico, had some skill with the instrument and was asked to play for select parties on the Foundation and for large groups of workers on Haven. This may not have been a good idea...

                across ALL of these HAP_Document-Skeleton.org Template

                  anchors within ALL of these HAP_Doc-Skeleton.org
                  Template files.

                  The anchor ~PREFIX_~ is there to match the named sections
                  of a book or document project defined as a standard
                  across ALL of these HAP_Document-Skeleton.org Template
                  files... This will help keep your anchors unique, and
                  also add an extra *KM* dimension of *category* to them...

                  It would be wise to follow this convention when you
                  create anchors elsewhere within ALL of your Book
                  Projects created from HAP Modular Emacs Document
                  Skeleton Template files...

                  If you wish to change all of this, go ahead and do
                  what ever you want... For simplicity's sake, follow
                  the instructions below... /(there are automatic ways/

This section is for a episode's Back Story development... The following tips will help you manage development of your back stories and how they will best fit into your evolving story... 

- =Keep Things Organized:= 

     - *Add Time Stamped Background Notes:* /(within the Background/ 
               /Notes section above)/ about new content added to this 
               Back Stories section as you progress over time...

     - *Add Time Stamps to:* Sub-headings within the Background 
               Notes Section that reflect back to paragraphs written 
               within this section...

     - *Add TODO Keywords* to sub-headings within the Background 
               Notes Section reflecting back to paragraphs written 
               within this section...

Doing the above steps will help you keep track of back story development and get better organized about how your book is developing, what areas need the most work, seeing problems that need to be resolved, etc.  Most importantly, this will help prevent you from making any grave mistakes causing contradictions within your story later... /(unless that was your intention/ /"Alfred Hitchcock")/... In any case you will be better informed by keeping things organized here where you can see them and resolve them quickly...

*** NEW 📰 Back Story: <2020-05-10 Sun> /(Example)/ 

- =NOTE= :: 

     This is an example of a back story related to this episode, or possibly connecting to another episode in your book... Write it down in the rough here and then later you can develop it further as needed. Keep Background Notes about this back story as well, AND keep them up to date as this story develops! 

** NEW 🗡 Plot(s):                                                            :noexport:

Keeping the above in mind while writing the plot summary of a episode, will help you get better organized about how your book is developing, what directions it is taking, what areas need the most work, where problems or inconsistencies may arise, etc.  

Most importantly, this will help prevent you from making any grave mistakes causing contradictions within your story later... /(unless that was your intention "Alfred Hitchcock")/...

In this episode we are dealing with yadda yadda yadda which must be resolved with yadda yadda yadda.  But be careful about Yadda Yadda Yadda as she does not exist in this Season's series yet!  Whaaat?  Nevermind... She never existed... Only in your dreams... The plot dissolves into tiny specs of sand on the marble floor...
Goldfish float belly up dead in their tank due to some un-identified shockwave of unknown origin passing through the bedroom just moments before... The uncertainty brings on feelings of Not Safe!!! Oh... Ah! There you are... Sigh of relief...

*** Sound Cue /(CLIPS)/ Numbering Convention: 

Sound Cues contain an identifying code number plus a short descriptive title... /(this way sound files can be sorted alphabetically and found easily when called for in a script (or cue sheet) during rehearsal or production time...)/

It's easy to call out these cues during a rehearsal... For instance, simply saying: /"SFX 102, 12, 25"/ and everyone will know we are talking about Sound Clip "25", playing in Episode 102, at Scene 12...

=Sound Cue Code Numbering Convention:=

  ~[SFX-E001-S001-C001]~
     \    \    \    \____ *Sound Cue #* /(or Clip #. 999 files/project)/
      \    \    \
       \    \    \____ *Scene #* /(999 Possible Scenes/Episode)/
        \    \    
         \    \____ *Episode #* /(999 Possible Episodes/Story)/
          \
           \____ *ID Mnemonic* /(Sound Effect, Environment Sound, Etc.)/

The numbering and naming of sound cues for an entire audio drama project are specified by using the Sound Cue Naming Convention above...

A Sound Cue Ending with the same ~C~ /(cue or clip number)/ may appear multiple
times within this entire Audio Theatre Project. This means that the same clip gets played multiple times within different settings, e.g., ~[SFX-E001-S001-C001]~, ~[SFX-E001-S025-C001]~, ~[SFX-E018-S013-C001]~, etc.  Common sounds like footsteps etc., appear many times. However, you may only have three or four versions of footsteps produced as clips...

=Special Case for:= /[SFX-E001-/ ~S000~ /-C001]/

If the above number contains scene number: ~S000~ This is a special number reserved for cues that play BEFORE the first scene or ANY scene in the episode where it may appear...

This is for things like The Entire Series Music Theme, Content with a Scope Beyond This Single Episode Alone, Orson Well's Historic Speech, /(lol)/ Whatever you want... These cues only appear at the very top of an episode's script, just before the first scene starts... By design, they cannot appear within Scenes...

- =NOTE=  :: All Audio Drama Projects based on this Template will use the same rules.. If identical Sound clips are needed by other projects, you will have to copy those associated files to the other project's media folder... /(i.e., they must be duplicated because other projects will/ /ONLY look for sound clips within their OWN MEDIA Folders).../ 

    In Addition to this... Project's MEDIA Folders may actually contain Symlinks to the Project's Accompanying DAW Project Folder's MEDIA folder...

    Redundancy /(i.e., multiple copies of media files)/ is fine as long as the sound files are not HUGE!!! If they ARE HUGE you may be better to use a simlink...

    The actual sound file names will NOT contain Episode or Scene number, but WILL contain the Sound Cue Number, AND a very short description of the sound itself...

    You have 999 different possible Sound Cue Numbers, which should be more than enough when combined with a short description to make ALL sound file names for a single project unique within their associated media folder...

    TO make this manageable /(multiple project wide)/, all post production ready sound files for any given project shall be kept in the accompanying project's ~media~ sub folder... This sub folder may in fact be a symlink to THIS Project's Accompanying DAW Project Folder's MEDIA folder... All Audio Theatre Projects have an associated DAW Project where Recorded Dialog is mixed with the music, sounds, everything... These two need to be linked together at the hip!

- =Note= :: Many *"stock"* sounds occur normally within multiple Episodes throughout a production project... These identical sound files are identified within the script by looking at the Cue number which MUST be UNIQUE within any given project... The Episode and Scene numbers may change but if the Cue Number is the same you know that it refers to a single sound file /(used multiple times within the script)/ 

    =Sound or Music?= Sometimes it is hard to decide whether a sound clip is "music", "background sound", or "sound effect" depending on the genre of the story etc... Use your best judgment when naming and assigning a sound file as "music" or "sfx"... You will be fine...

:README: 
*Episodes* are the *Top Level Headings* within this *Emacs Org-mode* Audio Drama Production Project... Built in LaTeX memoir styles insure that Episode and Scene numbering work without needing any of your input... You only need to insure your anchors are unique!

- [ ] *USAGE:* [0/2] 

   =This is the MASTER EPISODE Reserved for LAST=

   1) [ ] =This item is BOILERPLATE= /(DON'T MESS with IT until THE END)/ 

         Do Not use this MASTER EPISODE while you are writing
         your book... =KEEP IT LAST= in your list of *Episode Headings*...
         Keep This Item set to ~:export:~ for all drafts...

         This Item contains LaTeX directives designating the end of
         the Audio Production's Episodes/Scenes etc, /i.e. the end of/
         ~\mainmatter~ and the start of Appendix, Index, if needed...
         /i.e.,/ ~\backmatter~

         =Warning:= /If another episode were to be placed AFTER this item,/
                  /it would show up as a NEW section outside of the book/
                  /proper!! NOT what you want!/

         =Therefore This:= *Episode Title Z* =Must Remain In Place AS IS=
         throughout the duration of your project until you reach Final
         Draft stage...

         *When That Time Comes, Do The Rest Of The Steps Below:*

   2) [ ] =Commandeer This as LAST EPISODE OF YOUR PRODUCTION:=

         very last episode in your production... /(Once you know that/

         allowing you to immediately begin writing it as your very
         LAST Episode in this Production...

         Rename *Episode Title Z:* /(MASTER - etc...)/ to a *Unique Title*
         and remove /(MASTER - etc...)/ in order to commandeer the
         entire item for your needs...

         =Do NOT PUT "EPISODE" in your Title!=

         Built in LaTeX memoir styles create a *Episode #* heading
         before your episode title heading to take care of sequence
         numbering automatically...

         Scenes are automatically numbered as well...

         You only need to insure your anchors are unique!

   3) [ ] =Change The Anchor Link= 

         Change the anchor /(directly under Episode Title)/ to match
         your new episode's title name...
         
         =Note:= I created the following convention for making unique
               anchors within ALL of these HAP_Doc-Skeleton.org
               Template files.

               The anchor ~PREFIX_~ is there to match the named sections
               of a book or document project defined as a standard
               across ALL of these HAP_Document-Skeleton.org Template
               files... This will help keep your anchors unique, and
               also add an extra *KM* dimension of *category* to them...

               It would be wise to follow this convention when you
               create anchors elsewhere within ALL of your Book
               Projects created from HAP Modular Emacs Document
               Skeleton Template files...

               If you wish to change all of this, go ahead and do
               what ever you want... For simplicity's sake, follow
               the instructions below... /(there are automatic ways/
               /to create links and anchors within org-mode... I/
               /prefer to do it manually... The alternate is a mess/
               /IMHO)/

         Leave ~EPI_~ as the anchor's prefix...
         /(as in boilerplate above)/ Use dashes to connect words
         /(all lower case)/ from your title...

         The anchor above may be used to link to this episode from
         Research or other sections of this project...
         /(Or even from/ ~.org~ /docs OUTSIDE of this file...)/
         
         /(which may or may not be published as links within the PDF)/

   4) [ ] =Replace Titles, Anchors, & Content Within This Section= 

         Change names to suit your needs, but keep the structure of
         *Episode / Scene / sub-headings* intact...
         
         /(i.e., change titles, anchors, and content only...)/

   5) [ ] =Add New Scenes as Needed= 

         Commandeer *Scenes X* as needed when first starting
         out on this LAST Episode... Read the *:README:* drawer
         under the Scene headings for more info...

         After that, =COPY/CLONE= *New Scene Y* to make more scenes
         as needed until you are finally planning to write your very
         last scene at the END of this production and ALL scenes before
         that are in final draft stage...
         
         Leave the original *New Scene Z* in place =AS IS= to
         be commandeered later to the VERY LAST Scene in the production...
         
         Read the *:README:* drawer under *New Scene Z* heading for
         more info...

   6) [ ] =Make Sure= *New Scene Z:* /(below)/ is commandeered as =LAST SCENE= 

         *New Scene Z:* contains LaTeX directives designating the end of
         the Audio Production's Episodes/Scenes etc, /i.e. the end of/
         ~\mainmatter~ and the start of Appendix, Index, if needed...
         /i.e.,/ ~\backmatter~ /(which may or may not appear at the end)/

         The LaTeX directive at the end of *New Scene Z*
         /(or title you change it to)/ must be left =AS IS= when
         you are commandeering the scene to fit in as the very last
         scene of the LAST Episode in your audio production...

         Do NOT touch *New Scene Z* until you are ready, and leave
         it tagged for ~:export:~ containing LaTeX directives, no
         matter what...

- [ ] *READ ABOUT THIS SECTION:* 
  
   Scenes are the DNA that make up the episodes in an audio production...
   Each Scene should have its own title or phrase... The LaTeX style
   configuration for this book template takes care of numbering Episodes
   and Scenes automatically...

   Episodes may contain several scenes... There can be many twisty paths
   all alike /(or all different)/... %~)

   Here is the =ULTIMATE MASTER WORKSPACE= for creating, developing, and 
   updating a *new scene*...

   All ideas, plots, dialog, sounds, music, production notes, etc. for a particular scene within this episode are developed here solely...

   One of the accompanying fountain drama scripts for this *Audio Drama Project* ~.org~ file /(named after this episode)/ contains a compilation of all the /fountain script snippits/ for all scenes developed within this single episode...

   Some elements created here will become part of the accompanying fountain drama script for this episode... /(e.g., dialog, notes, narration, etc.)/ 

   The accompanying fountain drama script for this episode must be kept up to date with final drafts and latest edits made solely here...

   The headings within this ~.org~ file can be tracked using ~GTD~ tags, and a *log* entry can keep track of time worked on them... Once a scene is in final draft stage, it can be marked *DONE* and the fountain script for the episode will be updated to reflect that scene's final draft state...

   *What is a Scene?*

   Scenes form the fabric within episodes of audio or radio programs...

   Scenes are small packages of isolated events relating to a single unique thread/picture knitted into a defined situation where particular events related to that situation play out...

   The scenes don't necessarily follow in chronological order but they relate to each other in the mosaic fabric of the story as it develops... 

   If a scene changes abruptly to some other situation, that may mean that the scene is over and a new one is starting... Usually a change of environment triggers a new scene...

<<SCENE_new-scene-y>>
:README: 
- [ ] *READ ABOUT THIS SECTION:* 
  
      Scenes are the DNA that make up the episodes in an audio production... Each Scene should have its own title or phrase... The LaTeX style configuration for this book template takes care of numbering Episodes and Scenes automatically...

      Episodes may contain several scenes... There can be many twisty paths all alike /(or all different)/... %~)

      Here is the =ULTIMATE MASTER WORKSPACE= for creating, developing, and updating a *new scene*...

      All ideas, plots, dialog, sounds, music, production notes, etc. for a particular scene within this episode are developed here solely...

      One of the accompanying fountain drama scripts for this *Audio Drama Project* ~.org~ file /(named after this episode)/ contains a compilation of all the /fountain script snippits/ for all scenes developed within this single episode...

      Some elements created here will become part of the accompanying fountain drama script for this episode... /(e.g., dialog, notes, narration, etc.)/ 

      The accompanying fountain drama script for this episode must be kept up to date with final drafts and latest edits made solely here...

      The headings within this ~.org~ file can be tracked using ~GTD~ tags, and a *log* entry can keep track of time worked on them... Once a scene is in final draft stage, it can be marked *DONE* and the fountain script for the episode will be updated to reflect that scene's final draft state...

      *What is a Scene?*

      Scenes form the fabric within episodes of audio or radio programs...

      Scenes are small packages of isolated events relating to a single unique thread/picture knitted into a defined situation where particular events related to that situation play out...

      The scenes don't necessarily follow in chronological order but they relate to each other in the mosaic fabric of the story as it develops... 

      If a scene changes abruptly to some other situation, that may mean that the scene is over and a new one is starting... Usually a change of environment triggers a new scene...

- [ ] *USAGE:* [0/2] 

     - [ ] =FIRST: Copy Clone This BOILERPLATE= *New Scene Y:* 

             Leave this BOILERPLATE *New Scene Y* in place Until you No Longer Have any more Scenes to write for this LAST Episode.

             =Do NOT CHANGE ITS CONTENT!...=
        
             Paste your clone just above it, /(below your existing Scenes)/ Your new clone will serve as your SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH, Etc... Scenes for this LAST Episode in this Audio Production... 

             Rename *New Scene X:* to a *Unique Title* and commandeer the entire item for your specific needs...

             =Do NOT PUT "Scene" in your Title!=

             Built in LaTeX memoir styles create a *Scene #* heading before your scene title heading to take care of sequence numbering automatically...

             You only need to insure your anchors are unique!

             =Add Your New Scene Content= under the provided standard production industry sub-headings...  Follow any directions found within the sub headings themselves...

             Change the ~:noexport:~ tag to ~:export:~ for this NEW REAL scene so it will show up when publishing drafts...

             =NOTE:= If you know for sure what your SECOND to LAST scene is, =COMMANDEER= This Item Instead of Copy/Clone...

             Otherwise, Once you know you are ready to start your LAST scene in this chapter, DELETE THIS: *New Scene Y* /(COPY/CLONE This One)/ Heading and all content... It is no longer needed...
        
             /(i.e., Time to Commandeer/ *New Scene Z* /as your LAST Sub Topic)/

     - [ ] =Change The Anchor Link= /(make it unique)/ 

             Change the _<<anchor>_ /(directly under your renamed scene heading)/ to match your new renamed scene title...
         
             =Note:= I created the following convention for making unique anchors within ALL of these HAP_Doc-Skeleton.org Template files.

             The anchor ~PREFIX_~ is there to match the named sections of a book or document project defined as a standard across ALL of these HAP_Document-Skeleton.org Template files... This will help keep your anchors unique, and also add an extra *KM* dimension of *category* to them...

             It would be wise to follow this convention when you create anchors elsewhere within ALL of your Book Projects created from HAP Modular Emacs Document Skeleton Template files...

             If you wish to change all of this, go ahead and do what ever you want... For simplicity's sake, follow the instructions below... /(there are automatic ways/ /to create links and anchors within org-mode... I/ /prefer to do it manually... The alternate is a mess/ /IMHO)/
         
             Leave ~SCENE_~ as the anchor's prefix... /(as in boilerplate anchor above)/ Use dashes to connect words /(all lower case)/ from your scene's title...

             The anchor above may be used to link to this Scene from Research or other sections of this project... /(Or even from/ ~.org~ /docs OUTSIDE of this file...)/

:README: 
This section is for a episode's Back Story development... The following tips will help you manage development of your back stories and how they will best fit into your evolving story... 

- =Keep Things Organized:= 

     1) [ ] *Add Time Stamped Background Notes:*
             /(within the Background/ /Notes section above)/ about new content added to this Back Stories section as you progress over time...

     2) [ ] *Add Time Stamps to:*
              Sub-headings within the Background Notes Section that reflect back to paragraphs written within this section...

     3) [ ] *Add TODO Keywords*
              to sub-headings within the Background Notes Section reflecting back to paragraphs written within this section...

Doing the above steps will help you keep track of back story development and get better organized about how your book is developing, what areas need the most work, seeing problems that need to be resolved, etc.  Most importantly, this will help prevent you from making any grave mistakes causing contradictions within your story later... /(unless that was your intention/ /"Alfred Hitchcock")/... In any case you will be better informed by keeping things organized here where you can see them and resolve them quickly...

=The Content Written Within This Section May or May Not be= =Added to actual Episodes/Scenes of your Book...=

*** NEW 📰 Back Story: <2020-05-10 Sun> /(Example)/ 

- =NOTE= :: This is an example of a back story related to this episode, 
        or possibly connecting to another episode in your book...

        Write it down in the rough here and then later you can develop it further as needed. Keep Background Notes about this back story as well, AND keep them up to date as this story develops!

** NEW 🗡 Plot(s):                                                            :noexport:

Plots and Sub Plots, /(Just Like Background Notes)/ are =META DATA= Not Intended to be Added back to the Episodes/Scenes of your Book... The purpose of Plot Summaries are to help you during    planning stages where you are trying to resolve that twisty mess you created... OMG!

Keeping the above in mind while writing the plot summary of a episode, will help you get better organized about how your book is developing, what directions it is taking, what areas need the most work, where problems or inconsistencies may arise, etc. 

Most importantly, this will help prevent you from making any grave mistakes causing contradictions within your story later... /(unless that was your intention "Alfred Hitchcock")/... In any case you will be better informed by keeping all your plot tasks here where you can see them and resolve them quickly...

** NEW 📢 Sound Cues:                                                     :noexport: 
*** Sound Cue /(CLIPS)/ Numbering Convention: 

Sound Cues contain an identifying code number plus a short descriptive title... /(this way sound files can be sorted alphabetically and found easily when called for in a script (or cue sheet) during rehearsal or production time...)/

It's easy to call out these cues during a rehearsal... For instance, simply saying: /"SFX 102, 12, 25"/ and everyone will know we are talking about Sound Clip "25", playing in Episode 102, at Scene 12...

=Sound Cue Code Numbering Convention:=

  ~[SFX-E001-S001-C001]~
     \    \    \    \____ *Sound Cue #* /(or Clip #. 999 files/project)/
      \    \    \
       \    \    \____ *Scene #* /(999 Possible Scenes/Episode)/
        \    \    
         \    \____ *Episode #* /(999 Possible Episodes/Story)/
          \
           \____ *ID Mnemonic* /(Sound Effect, Environment Sound, Etc.)/

The numbering and naming of sound cues for an entire audio drama project are specified by using the Sound Cue Naming Convention above...

A Sound Cue Ending with the same ~C~ /(cue or clip number)/ may appear multiple
times within this entire Audio Theatre Project. This means that the same clip gets played multiple times within different settings, e.g., ~[SFX-E001-S001-C001]~, ~[SFX-E001-S025-C001]~, ~[SFX-E018-S013-C001]~, etc.  Common sounds like footsteps etc., appear many times. However, you may only have three or four versions of footsteps produced as clips...

=Special Case for:= /[SFX-E001-/ ~S000~ /-C001]/

If the above number contains scene number: ~S000~ This is a special number reserved for cues that play BEFORE the first scene or ANY scene in the episode where it may appear...

This is for things like The Entire Series Music Theme, Content with a Scope Beyond This Single Episode Alone, Orson Well's Historic Speech, /(lol)/ Whatever you want... These cues only appear at the very top of an episode's script, just before the first scene starts... By design, they cannot appear within Scenes...

- =NOTE= :: All Audio Drama Projects based on this Template will use the same rules.. 
     If identical Sound clips are needed by other projects, you will have to copy those associated files to the other project's media folder... /(i.e., they must be duplicated because other projects will/ /ONLY look for sound clips within their OWN MEDIA Folders).../

     In Addition to this... Project's MEDIA Folders may actually contain Symlinks to the Project's Accompanying DAW Project Folder's MEDIA folder...

     Redundancy /(i.e., multiple copies of media files)/ is fine as long as the sound files are not HUGE!!! If they ARE HUGE you may be better to use a simlink...

     The actual sound file names will NOT contain Episode or Scene number, but WILL contain the Sound Cue Number, AND a very short description of the sound itself...

     You have 999 different possible Sound Cue Numbers, which should be more than enough when combined with a short description to make ALL sound file names for a single project unique within their associated media folder...

     TO make this manageable /(multiple project wide)/, all post production ready sound files for any given project shall be kept in the accompanying project's ~media~ sub folder... This sub folder may in fact be a symlink to THIS Project's Accompanying DAW Project Folder's MEDIA folder... All Audio Theatre Projects have an associated DAW Project where Recorded Dialog is mixed with the music, sounds, everything... These two need to be linked together at the hip!

- =NOTE= :: Many *"stock"* sounds occur normally within multiple Episodes 
     throughout a production project... These identical sound files are identified within the script by looking at the Cue number which MUST be UNIQUE within any given project... The Episode and Scene numbers may change but if the Cue Number is the same you know that it refers to a single sound file /(used multiple times within the script)/

- =Sound or Music?= Sometimes it is hard to decide whether a sound clip is 
    "music", "background sound", or "sound effect" depending on the genre of the story etc... Use your best judgment when naming and assigning a sound file as "music" or "sfx"... You will be fine...

times within this entire Audio Theatre Project. This means that the same clip gets played multiple times within different settings, e.g., ~[MUS-E001-S001-M001]~, ~[MUS-E001-S025-M001]~, ~[MUS-E018-S013-M001]~, etc.  Common music like intro themes, exit themes, etc., appear many times... 

=Special Case for:= /[MUS-E001-/ ~S000~ /-M001]/

If the above number contains scene number: ~S000~ This is a special number reserved for cues that play BEFORE the first scene or ANY scene in the episode where it may appear...

This is for things like The Entire Series Music Theme, Content with a Scope Beyond This Single Episode Alone, Orson Well's Historic Speech, /(lol)/ Whatever you want... These cues only appear at the very top of an episode's script, just before the first scene starts... By design, they cannot appear within Scenes...

- =NOTE= :: All Audio Drama Projects 
     based on this Template will use the same rules.. If identical Music clips are needed by other projects, you will have to copy those associated files to the other project's media folder... /(i.e., they must be duplicated because other projects will/ /ONLY look for music clips within their OWN MEDIA Folders).../

     In Addition to this... Project's MEDIA Folders may actually contain Symlinks to the Project's Accompanying DAW Project Folder's MEDIA folder...

     Redundancy /(i.e., multiple copies of media files)/ is fine as long as the music files are not HUGE!!! If they ARE HUGE you may be better to use a simlink...

     The actual music file names will NOT contain Episode or Scene number, but WILL contain the Music Cue Number, AND a very short description of the music itself...

     You have 999 different possible Music Cue Numbers, which should be more than enough when combined with a short description to make ALL music file names for a single project unique within their associated media folder...

     TO make this manageable /(multiple project wide)/, all post production ready music files for any given project shall be kept in the accompanying project's ~media~ sub folder... This sub folder may in fact be a symlink to THIS Project's Accompanying DAW Project Folder's        MEDIA folder... All Audio Theatre Projects have an associated DAW Project where Recorded Dialog is mixed with the music, sounds, everything... These two need to be linked together at the hip!

- =NOTE= :: *"stock"* music may occur 
     multiple times within multiple Episodes and Scenes throughout a production project... These identical music files are identified within the script by looking at the Music Cue Number which MUST be UNIQUE within any given project...
     
     The Episode and Scene numbers may change but if the Music Cue Number is the same you know that it refers to a single music file /(used multiple times within the script)/

- =Sound or Music?= 
     Sometimes it is hard to decide whether a clip is /"music"/ , /"background sound"/ , /"sound effect"/ or, in many cases /a morph of all-the-above!!!/ depending on the genre of the story etc... Use your best judgment when naming and assigning a sound file as "music" or "sfx"... =You will be fine...=

=Using the Clocking Feature of this Log Entry=

- [ ] *Go To One of the HEADINGS Below:*

         /(Summary, Details, or Sub Headings)/

         =Punch the Time Clock:= /(see Clocking Commands: below)/ At
         the heading And then begin working on a task related to
         that Heading...

         =Your Time IS being Recorded Now= /(you will see a/ *:clocking:*
         /item under the heading where time is recorded)/

- [ ] =Use These Clocking Commands:= /to keep track your time.../

     - *Clock IN:* ~C-c C-x C-i~ /(Begin OR Resume Clocking Current task)/

           This creates a new :CLOCKING: Time Card Entry just
           underneath the HEADING...

           Do this just before starting work on the task... 
           Be in control of your life!

           After doing the above, you can go away and do some 
           work, leaving this heading, log note, etc. to visit 
           other files and/or work on them etc. The clock will 
           be recording your time all the while... You will see 
           in your mode line the elapsed clock time ticking away 
           as you work on a task /(hopefully related to this clock!)/
           and NOT Yac Shaving or being sidetracked!!!

     - *RETURN to Clock Heading:* ~C-c C-x C-j~

           /Go back to the place where you started the clock.../

           You do this after you have worked on a task for a 
           while and you need to come back to update the item's
           info etc., and/or stop the clock before going off to 
           do something else unrelated to the log entry...

     - *Clock OUT:* ~C-c C-x C-o~ /(to stop clocking your time on task)/

           This *Finalizes the Time Card Entry* within:
           ~:CLOCKING:~ /(created earlier when you started the clock)/

           The Clock Entry changes showing start timestamp, end
           timestamp, and total time worked during this segment...  

           =Please DON'T Forget= /Like I often do, LOL.../ i.e., Leaving
           a clock running all day by accident, or worse, leave it
           dangling with the file closed only to open it again and
           get that nasty *Org-Mode Message:* /"What do you want to do/
           /with this?"/ If you do something like that you can always
           come back and directly edit the clock times by hand to
           amend them...  After changing clock times or dates, etc...
           Whatever...

                 ="Onward We Row Mates... Through the log jam!"=

     - *Update Time Card Entry:* ~C-c C-c~ 

           This command will change the total time at the end showing 
           your new calculated time...

           If you need to go away and do something else before finishing
           this task, you can do so after clocking out... When you come
           back simply clock back in again to start another Time Card
           Entry just as before... The new time card entry will appear
           above the earlier one within the ~:CLOCKING:~ drawer... When
           you clock out of this task it will look just like the entry
           below it with a total time worked tagged on the end...

     - *Clock Out & Mark Items Done:* ~C-c C-t~

           When you are all done with a Log Entry use the above key 
           command to mark its Heading *TODO* tag to: *DONE* /(Most of the/ 
           /time this will ALSO clock you out if you are still clocked/ 
           /into the item... But not allways in my experience.../  
           So make sure you are also clocked OUT of an Item After 
           marking it DONE... Type: ~C-c C-x C-j~ to check this...
           /(if no running clock it will tell you and place your/
           /cursor at the heading where you LAST CLOCKED OUT)/

     - ~C-c C-x C-q~ *Cancel Current Clock:* /(in case of accident)/

           This removes currently running clock and forgets any time
           accrued or associated with it...

     - ~C-c C-x C-d~ *Display Clocking Info:* 

           /This will show elapsed times to the right of headings.../
           =Warning!= Using this command will CLUTTER ALL the headings
                    within your org file with those timestamps!!!

Also the *Time Card* /displayed above/ each search hit will give more clues by showing important headings you worked on...

The Synopsis Tasks provided below are important first steps to take when first starting a novel.  They are based on the "Snowflake Method" by Randy Ingermanson... 

These tasks should be started as soon as you create a new project using this: *HAP_Audio-Drama-Project-Template* 

It is hoped that this process will give you a faster, efficient, organized "bootstrapped" head start and teach some guidance about how to properly organize, write, and produce an audio drama with a 
clearer mind, inspired outlook, and renewed motivation...
:END:
** 📋 Synopsis Tasks: 
:README: 
=Do These Synopsis Tasks FIRST When Starting a NEW Audio Project=

After completing each Timestamped Step below, Mark its TODO state to ~DONE~ and update the timestamp to the current time as well...  Use Command: ~C-c . . RET~ while cursor is on the timestamp to update it to the current date/time... 

The Synopsis Tasks below are based on The Award winning Snowflake Method created by [[https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/][Randy Ingermanson]] of Ingermanson Communications, Inc. You could write anything you want for a synopsis...

=It is HIGHLY Recommended= for you to use the steps below FIRST before doing any other writing!  This advise comes from many highly acclaimed master authors! /(including Mark Twain himself!)/
:END:
*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Do This First: =Important= 

=NOTE:= Before you start you need to answer the following questions:

- [ ] *What is your main category or genera?* 

       _______________________________________

- [ ] *You write within this genera because?* 

       _______________________________________

- [ ] *Listeners will be attracted to and enjoy your stories because?* 

       _______________________________________

After completing above, follow the steps below...

*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Step One - Write a Single Sentence Summary: 

=Take An Hour And Write A One-Sentence Summary Of Your Production:= 
   
*Something like this:* 

   /"A gourmet chef from Boston acedentally falls into a parallel/ 
    /world, almost destroyed by an arch enemy he did not even know/ 
    /he had, then he discovers he is immortal and meets-re-discovers/ 
    /his ancient soul mate of eons. Together they save the universe/ 
    /after all else fails!"/

OK I know... I cheated. The second sentence is a stinger. It needs to stand alone... I often buck the rules... lol

The sentence you end up writing above will serve you forever as a ten-second selling tool. This exercise defines the big picture illustrated by the first simple triangle in the snowflake diagram /(as explained to Goldilocks and/ /classmates by Baby Bear in: Chapter 4 of Randy Ingermanson's Book:/ /"How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method")/

Within that same chapter, Baby Bear also pointed out this important fact to keep in mind: 
/(Illustrated "Radio Drama" Style Just For Fun, Because We Can... ;-)/

#+BEGIN_SRC fountain 
= A screenplay adaptation of an excerpt of dialog witin chapter 4 of:
= "How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method" by: Randy Ingermanson

# Somewhere in the middle of Scene One:

INT. (BABY BEAR'S CLASSROOM - DAY)

_1. SOUND [CREAKING & THUD OF TABLE AS BABY BEAR JUMPS UP ON TOP]_

2.

BABY BEAR
(RECOVERING BALANCE, GRUNT, DEEP ENHALE)
    
This is important, you novelists!
   
You're going to get lots of advice on how to write a novel.  
    
But that's all it is. Advice. If you don't like that advice, 
    
if it doesn't work for you, then ignore it.  
    
If it does work for you, then run with it.

#+END_SRC

I agree... Don't let anybody steer you away from your muses! But at the same time don't ignore the basics!

This synopsis stuff is basic to the bone! It is universal... We cannot buck it!  It's based on human nature... Your sentence above, will serve as a pitch during normal conversations /(to see if there is any interest)/...

=Memorize "your line"= to the point that you can say it in your sleep! Turn it into a "slogan" /(hopefully a "meme" if you are the lucky type)/. Your goal is that others will remember and be able to easily tell all their friends /(word/ /for word)/. Networking is the key! You can't do it alone... Songs are also great help! /(cartoons and songs are killer!)/ Social networks open you up to sky limit possibilities!

=Lead with your story line while engaging with a total stranger= or even your mother. =Remain silent after that=... Wait to see if there is interest before diving deeper... That and your good body language "posture" will take care of everything...

- =Important!= Closing rules of sales dictate the law of attraction always applies.. Pushing yields negative results... =If you push people... They push back...=
  
    =If you run away from people, they chase you...= 

    To eat, or to be eaten... That's what it all comes down to. lol Wait to see if there is interest... 

    =If NOT, Move On...= 
    =If YES... Do The Next Step...=

    When the time comes for you to Pitch Your Production Work, this sentence should appear very early in the proposal. It's the hook that will get executive producers coming to the table to talk business, to inspire your cast/crew, the sales force, the networks, and ultimately to listeners. So make the best one you can!

***** Here are some tips: 

- *Shorter is better. Try for fewer than 15 words.* 

- *No character names, please!* 
  
    Better to say "a handicapped trapeze artist" than "Jane Doe".

- *Tie together the big picture and the personal picture.* 
  
    Which character has the most to lose in this story? Now tell me what he or she wants to win.

- *Read the one-line blurbs on the New York Times Bestseller list* 

     This will teach you how to do it by example. Writing a one-sentence description is an art form. If you become a master at this, marketing firms will want you madly!

- *Check out:* [[yt:feD-dImM4a8][LEGO Star Wars: The Last Jedi in 60 Seconds]] 

     /(and other 60 second movies like it)/ for a completely different audio/visual parallel to this literary concept...

*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Step Two - Expand Summary to Paragraph 

=Take another hour and expand your sentence= from step one into a full paragraph describing the story setup, major disasters, and ending of the series.

This step defines the second stage of the snowflake model... as illustrated by further trisections of the triangle producing the snowflake diagram /(as explained to Goldilocks and classmates by Baby Bear in chapter 5, "The Importance of being Disastrous" in Randy Ingermanson's book: "How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method")/

For this step, *visualize the story as having "three disasters plus an ending"* 

For normal Fiction Authors, each of the disasters takes a quarter of a book (fiction novel) to develop and the ending takes the final quarter. 

Things are a bit different for an on-going audio drama production... You may have to overlap several *"Hero's journeys"* in parallel, and weave them into your episodes, as the story evolves over time... 

The reason for this requirement is because =EACH EPISODE is a MINI SELF CONTAINED Hero's Journey= that stands alone with a satisfying conclusion, but there is a teasing stinger at the end...

The stinger or *"cliff hanger"* at the end of each episode leads listeners
interest to continue with the next exciting adventure to come... /(another mini hero's journey)/

A natural expansion of the *"SOLO" Hero's Journey* form that fits well within a Full Many-Seasons Episode Series will showcase a =TEAM of HEROS= expansion on the hero's journey form as commonly found within fiction, and Cinema... 

The Team Hero's Concept Started in Comic Books long ago, but has returned today within Cinema and Video Games AND VR with a vengeance!

No one claims this to be an absolute ideal structure, but it's the one that Randy Ingermanson uses, and it has a strong basis in psychology. I personally believe it to be based on the more general Sonnet Poetic Form, which mirrors the Sonata Musical Form, 

I don't know what the parallel architectural form or term for this idea is, /(there are so many classical forms in architecture).../ But something within the world of architecture, contained in its most basic pure form, there must exist an exact parallel to "the Hero's Journey" form of Dramatic Arts. I am sure you can see, most of the classical forms follow golden mean, Fibbonochi shapes and dimensions... Oh.. but I digress! %^)

You may find it easier to keep the main synopsis very short, but add mini synopsis for each episode using the same methods below...

=If you believe in the Three-Act structure, then:=

- *The first disaster would correspond to the end of Act 1* 

- *The second disaster would be the mid-point of Act 2* 

- *The third disaster would come at the end of Act 2, and force Act 3* 

- *Act 3 wraps everything up* 

**** Make 5 Sentences: [0/5] 
:README: 
=Note:= The steps below could be done to write a single synopsis for the ENTIRE PRODUCTION OR write individual synopsis to include within EACH EPISODE OR you combine BOTH methods above... /(i.e. One/ /MASTER synopsis, and many individual EPISODE/ /synopsis./
:END:

1. [ ] =Exposition:= 

        This sentence's purpose is to paint the story setting, backdrop and mention leading characters within a descriptive role... The mood is set here briefly, dripping with consentrated visions of expectation!

2. [ ] =Act One:= - *First Disaster Summary* 

        The first disaster emerges out of circumstance. This is the key event that motivates our lead character /(hero)/ to find a remedy.  This disaster must hit home to our readers as well, inspiring them along side our hero as faithful evangelists... 

3. [ ] =First Half of Act Two:= - *Second Disaster Summary* 

        The second disaster is the result of our budding hero's attempt to "fix things" after the first disaster in Act One. But things keep getting worse, not better.  As a result, our hero experiences an epiphany, realizing the errors of her ways, and resolves to do things the correct way from that moment on... /(the music changes, new hope emerges)/

4. [ ] =Second Half of Act Two:= - *Third Disaster & Standoff Summary* 

        The last half of Act 2 is the standoff between your hero and villain or obstacle... Here is where your hero's new resolve to doing the right thing begins to pay off. However this act ends with the third disaster... Act 3 will determine the final outcome.

5. [ ] =Act 3 Summary:= *(conclusion)* 

        This is where it all previous conflicts are finally resolved, one way or the other... Whether or not the lead character /(hero)/ whatever succeeds or fails.  The story once resolved ends as a comedy, tragedy, or mellowdrama... You decide on that...

**** Using Your One-Paragraph Summary: 

You will be using this paragraph in your proposals. It is only for your agents etc.  Not for your readers who need to be kept in the dark about how the story develops before reading the book! =Watch Out Spoilers!=

=However=, Some of this paragraph /(written with parts pourposefully left out or with questions put in place)/ may end up as promotional material and or short previews of your Audio Production.

*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Step Three - Expand Paragraph to Synopsis: 

=Take several hours to expand each sentence= of your summary paragraph into a full paragraph. 

*All but the last paragraph should end in a disaster.* The final paragraph is the final conclusion to those disasters bringing your story to a close.

You can employ the snowflake method at finer levels here... Breaking each paragraph into mini disasters or turning points within the main disaster, etc.

By this stage, you should have a good idea of the large-scale structure of your audio production, and you have only spent a day or two, or at most, a week or two, but all that time will not have been wasted! You will now have a good idea if there are problems with your story. This is good knowledge to have now, rather than after investing 500 hours in a rambling first draft.

At the end of this exercise, you will have a nice one-page skeleton of your Audio Production as a whole or at least the first few episodes, each with their own self contained synopsis. It's fine if your skeletons do not fit all on one single-spaced page as long as they don't go beyond that... 

Your process now is to grow these ideas as episodes within your story. You are expanding the conflict. You have a synopsis suitable for a proposal, and you are well on your way to doing extended promotion...

*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Completion: 

- [ ] *Copy one-page skeleton from:* =Step Three= 
         above under the: 📝 *Synopsis:* Heading inside the 📕 *Production Front Matter:* Binder...

        When you are done with these Synopsis tasks, you will have completed half the battle of producing your Audio Drama! The other half is getting to know your characters...
     
        Plots, Episodes, and Scenes will flow from that effortlessly... 

** 👤 Character Tasks:

   - [ ] =After completing each Timestamped Step=

            =Use Command:= ~C-c . RET~ while cursor is on the timestamp to update it to the current date/time...

            This is all to aid you while you are working on a new character... Once your character is reasonably set up... Reset all the TODO States to ~NEW~ for the next character you will be doing this for...

            You can also mark the TODO states of any of the headings within your final Character Item's Profile as you are working on them there...

   - =Some Of These Character Tasks= 
        are based on the Snowflake Method as outlined in Randy Ingermanson's book:
        [[https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/]["How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method"]] 

        Other tasks are based on concepts outlined within the book: 
         [[https://www.kmweiland.com/wp-content/uploads/crafting-unforgettable-characters.pdf]["Crafting Unforgettable Characters" by; K.M. Weiland]] 

        The second book is a free download from: [[https://www.kmweiland.com/][K.M. Weilands Website]] where you can find other great books and writers resources... 

        Much of what you will be filling in below is based on the above two books but no more instruction is given here as to the why or how... Only dry forms have been included here to make it convenient for you to complete this process...  

        =You are strongly encouraged= to purchase and read the above two books so that you will have a deeper understanding while you work through this process...

        The tasks within this section will be used to produce a *"Character Bible"* /(Binder)/ for each character in your story. The Character Bible in turn will be used to create your character's Official Profile & Synopsis... /(which is a/ /more formal and condensed presentation Binder without/ /all the worksheets, interviews, and     details...)/

        =A character bible is the private lifetime personell file= of a character...  It will hold scrapbook like items of importance throughout the character's life...  

        There's a TV show on Amazon called: *"Hanna"* where this concept has been illustrated perfectly! In this CIA black ops thriller, Babies DNA are enhanced with wolf genes to make them grow up into super soldiers... When these children get deployed /(looking as normal youths/ /in high school)/, they are each assigned a scrap-book containing all of their *"character's"* vital details. There are pictures of family, best friends, past events, etc. Their photo is on the front cover...

        =All of it is fake...=, BUT as these secret CIA teens carry out roll play /(within their fake role as normal high school students)/, soon... they begin to believe more and more that they actually "are" who their scrapbook profiles say they are and not trained CIA agents anymore! 

        This TV Series does an excellent Job of Illustrating: =The Power Of Getting Immersed Emphatically With Your Characters!=

  Memacs extracts metadata /(subjects, timestamps, contact information, etc.)/ from many different existing data sources /(file names, emails, tweets, bookmarks, etc.)/ on your computer and generates files which are readable by GNU Emacs with Org-Mode...

  The tables produced by Org mode are pretty basic by default. However, you can use the LaTeX *tabularray* package to customise the look of your tables.

  The answer to this question explains: ~longtable :align |p{3cm}|p{6cm}|l|l|l|l|l|l|~ /(etc.)/
  Where you replace any ~| l |~ /(column)/ with ~p{*cm}~ where ~*~ can be any numeral as required to fit table to page... /(i.e., hard wired column widths)/

** 📄 Instructions: 
*** Using Templates: 

- [ ] *Choose One Of The Templates Below And Copy It:* 

       /(Copy the entire template and all of its contents - folded)/  

- [ ] *Paste The Copied Template As A New Clone:* 

       /(Paste it within your project's Production, or Research section/ 
        /where it would normally belong)/

- [ ] *Change The Name Of Your Clone:* 

       /(Change the name to a specific title needed to fit/ 
        /in with your project's story-structure.../  
        /In the case of Logs or Tasks, you probably will/

        /but you may wish to further qualify them by adding/ 
        /a prefixed category word.)/

*** Instructions for Exporting Fountain Scripts: 

Fountain screenplay scripts created within this project can be exported using the *afterwriting* python tool... Follow Instructions section below under the *Fountain 2 PDF:* heading for more about how to do that...

**** Fountain 2 PDF 

The ~Audio-Drama~ project folder that contains this file also contains external files for exporting the project's fountain script(s) to a PDF file formatted to HAP Radio Drama Script style. Instructions and info for further customizations of your final output follow...

I am now employing Afterwriting to perform the conversion and export job... No longer needing to dip into the LaTeX bowels for screenplays... Thank God!

[[https://github.com/ifrost/afterwriting-labs/blob/master/docs/clients.md]]

I plan to interface Emacs org-mode with afterwriting to produce output PDFs with just a few keystrokes while editing this file in Emacs...

Before using this you must have afterwriting globally installed on your machine using NPM

Install afterwriting globally on your machine: (assuming you already have Node.js npm installed & updated to latest LTS):

Most of the information below under the first sections starting with Afterwriting config file: was copied (reprinted from original markdown) from: Github:ifrost/afterwriting-labs/CLI Tool therefore due credit goes to ifrost for most of the instructions below...

The sections below where I begin using the information above to customize my own config.json file are my own... Based on much trial and error, as well as reading other docs on the fountain.org website...

***** Generic Afterwriting Config File 

The output can be customized using configuration file passed as --config parameter. Config should be a JSON with this structure:

<<LOG_Generic-Title>>
:README: 
   =Using the Clocking Feature of this Log Entry=

- [ ] *Go To One of the HEADINGS Below:* 

         /(Summary, Details, or Sub Headings)/

         =Punch the Time Clock:= /(see Clocking Commands: below)/ At
         the heading And then begin working on a task related to
         that Heading...

         =Your Time IS being Recorded Now= /(you will see a/ *:clocking:*
         /item under the heading where time is recorded)/

- [ ] =Use These Clocking Commands:= /to keep track your time.../ 

     - *Clock IN:* ~C-c C-x C-i~ /(Begin OR Resume Clocking Current task)/ 

           This creates a new :CLOCKING: Time Card Entry just
           underneath the HEADING...

           Do this just before starting work on the task... 
           Be in control of your life!

           After doing the above, you can go away and do some 
           work, leaving this heading, log note, etc. to visit 
           other files and/or work on them etc. The clock will 
           be recording your time all the while... You will see 
           in your mode line the elapsed clock time ticking away 
           as you work on a task /(hopefully related to this clock!)/
           and NOT Yac Shaving or being sidetracked!!!

     - *RETURN to Clock Heading:* ~C-c C-x C-j~ 

           /Go back to the place where you started the clock.../

           You do this after you have worked on a task for a 
           while and you need to come back to update the item's
           info etc., and/or stop the clock before going off to 
           do something else unrelated to the log entry...

     - *Clock OUT:* ~C-c C-x C-o~ /(to stop clocking your time on task)/ 

           This *Finalizes the Time Card Entry* within:
           ~:CLOCKING:~ /(created earlier when you started the clock)/

           The Clock Entry changes showing start timestamp, end
           timestamp, and total time worked during this segment...  

           =Please DON'T Forget= /Like I often do, LOL.../ i.e., Leaving
           a clock running all day by accident, or worse, leave it
           dangling with the file closed only to open it again and
           get that nasty *Org-Mode Message:* /"What do you want to do/
           /with this?"/ If you do something like that you can always
           come back and directly edit the clock times by hand to
           amend them...  After changing clock times or dates, etc...
           Whatever...

                 ="Onward We Row Mates... Through the log jam!"=

     - *Update Time Card Entry:* ~C-c C-c~ 

           This command will change the total time at the end showing 
           your new calculated time...

           If you need to go away and do something else before finishing
           this task, you can do so after clocking out... When you come
           back simply clock back in again to start another Time Card
           Entry just as before... The new time card entry will appear
           above the earlier one within the ~:CLOCKING:~ drawer... When
           you clock out of this task it will look just like the entry
           below it with a total time worked tagged on the end...

     - *Clock Out & Mark Items Done:* ~C-c C-t~ 

           When you are all done with a Log Entry use the above key 
           command to mark its Heading *TODO* tag to: *DONE* /(Most of the/ 
           /time this will ALSO clock you out if you are still clocked/ 
           /into the item... But not allways in my experience.../  
           So make sure you are also clocked OUT of an Item After 
           marking it DONE... Type: ~C-c C-x C-j~ to check this...
           /(if no running clock it will tell you and place your/
           /cursor at the heading where you LAST CLOCKED OUT)/

     - ~C-c C-x C-q~ *Cancel Current Clock:* /(in case of accident)/ 

           This removes currently running clock and forgets any time
           accrued or associated with it...

     - ~C-c C-x C-d~ *Display Clocking Info:* 

           /This will show elapsed times to the right of headings.../
           =Warning!= Using this command will CLUTTER ALL the headings
                    within your org file with those timestamps!!!

****** NEW <2022-08-26 Fri> 👤 Detailed Character Interview: [0/2] 

- [ ] *Perform a Detailed Character Interview:*  

       This is best done as a "role play" exercise where you become "the character" who is having an interview with a doctor, or lawyer, or someone qualified to keep secrets confidential etc. Some of the information below would be provided via written examination... Other things would be done face to face... You will know the context when you get to those points...

       Doing it this way will put you in the right emotional framework. You will adopt this character's normal anxiety, expectations, assumptions, prejustice etc. You will end up feeling this character's impressions of the various questions on the forms, and you will feel this persons emotions and expectations going into a face to face interview... The results will be more authentic about the character and less, if anything at all about you the author...

*** NEW ♾ New World: /(Master Template)/ 
:README: 
- *DEFINITION:* 
     =From Wikipedia:= "In its most general sense, the term "world" refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything that is. The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields."

     *For Our Purposes as Fiction Authors:* Our Definition shall be a *"plurality of worlds"* Worlds which are Still =ALL encompassing BUT= =Not Encompassing ALL= so-to-speak...

     Worlds are Different than Regions because Worlds simply "exist" without the influence of any outside artificial influence... Worlds can be quite "nebulous" ♾ creatures! Regions are based on defined formalized constraints...

- *World Creation Can be Tricky:* 

     If you fall into a black rabbit hole through the centre of the earth, /(Like Alice).../ What happens when you come out the other side? Will everyone in China be upside down? 

     Expanding on the confusing =ALL Encompassing= statement from our *World* definition above, The following ideas are assumed for:

- *New Worlds Created Here:* 

     =A= *♾ New World* =May-Or-May-Not Contain One-Or-Many= *Locations/Regions* 

     =A= *♾ New World* =May-Or-May-Not Contain One-Or-Many= *Planets or Satellites*

     =A= *♾ New World* =May Be Something OTHER than:= *Planet or Satellite*

     =A= *♾ New World* =May-Or-May-Not be BASED on= *Classical Euclidean Space*

     =A= *♾ New World* =May CONTAIN or BE CONTAINED by OTHER WORLDS or THINGS!!!=

     =And For-that-matter...= 

     Worlds, Regions, Locations, Planets, Satellites, COULD ALL contain One or MORE New Worlds within them!

- *New Worlds Containing Guess what?* 

     =OMG Girl! Do The Math! %^)= 

     /(If you write Sci-Fi, the possibilities are mind boggling!)/

     /"Eat just a wee bit of the proper side of that mushroom and you/ /will be too big to be a dog's meal but small enough to follow/ /the rabbit through/ /that small door..."/

     =For Most Cases= *♾ New World:* Items will be created in conjunction  with corresponding Regions, Planets, Groups, etc... /(no matter what/ /their hierarchical relationship may be...)/

- [ ] *USAGE:* [0/4] 

      For most common cases, you will need to create a New World as a container for any defined Regions, Planets, Groups, etc., Which... in turn were created because they are the reference source for elements within your evolving story (book)...

      However, you may be inspired to create much more interesting Worlds /(all by themselves unique jewels)/ that end up becoming Bizarr Cases that Do NOT Contain any of the classical kinds of things you might find normally within Euclidean space, depending on the nature of your story...

*** NEW ✨ New Region: /(Master Template)/ 
:README: 
- *DEFINITION:* 

     A Region Is Defined As: An "area" or "space" which is broadly divided by physical characteristics /(physical geography)/, any impact characteristics of inhabitants /(bio geography)/, and the interaction of inhabitants with the area's environment /(environmental geography)/. 

     The word *"region"* is taken from the Latin *regio* /(derived from/ /regere, 'to rule')/ In mathematics the term: *"domain"* is a similar concept to the generalized idea of *"regions"* as defined within various geographical sciences: /(e.g., physical geography, ecology,/ /biogeography, zoogeography, environmental geography, ethnography,/ /etc.)/ And of course all of the *Exo-* versions of these as well...

     Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in the case where some governing body has defined artificial borders. 

     Apart from geographic regions, there are also hydrospheric and atmospheric regions. /(e.g., oceans, lakes, rivers, discrete/ /climates of elevations above sea level)/... Add to this the infinite possibilities of *"exo-regions"* which are not even defined yet! 

     /That is... Until your Muses Inspire you to/ /Define a NEW Exotic "exo-region"!/ 

     Regions are Different than Worlds because they are defined by consensus of some governing body or artificial principal... Worlds simply "exist" without the influence of any outside artificial constraints... Worlds are "nebulous" creatures! 

- *This Region Business Can Be Tricky:* 

      =A Region Can Exist Such As:= *The French Quarter of New Orleans* which exists inside a *city* located within *yet another defined* *region* called: *"South LA Delta Region"* which could also be called part of the *"Deep South Region"* etc. etc. etc...

      OK... =How About a Region Defined by a Street Intersection?= *Times Square* region of *NYC*, /(which is a city but also a region/ /containing many regions which also contain regions)/...

      If you are a Sci-Fi author the concept of a Location and/or region can become even more convoluted... Interdimensional regions may exist in fractal permutations all of them suspended in flux within the space of a single but fancy space ship...  A space ship which also travels through multidimensional regions of space at the same time in parallel with other instances of itself... =OMG!= 

      =And For-that-matter...= 

      Worlds, Regions, Locations, Planets, Satellites, COULD ALL contain One or MORE New Worlds within them!

      /(If you write Sci-Fi, the possibilities are mind boggling!)/

      =For Most Cases:= Any *✨ New Region:* Items defined will have corresponding and related Items defined somewhere in the *🔍 Research:* Section as well...

- [ ] *USAGE:* [0/4] 

      For most common cases, you will need to create a New Region as a container for a defined Planet, or Group, etc... Which... in turn were created because they are the reference source for elements within your evolving story (book)...

      However, you may be inspired to create a smaller Region which may be contained within a special World, or localized to a planet or other body in space, or even some small microscopic region inside a single drop of water! All of the above depending on the nature of your story...

      =Add:= As Many *✨ New Region:* Headings As Needed And Are Important To Include As Reference For The Writing
