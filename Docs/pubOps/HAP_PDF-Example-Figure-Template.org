#+DESCRIPTION: HAP - Simple Document Skeleton to create short excrpt figures or examples that may or may not be originally from a larger Document or Book Project... These are most commonly created to serve in support of a larger project, But Publishable as a Simple STAND ALONE PDF when that's the only thing needed to look up.

#+BEGIN_COMMENT

=Setup Files:=

   For Cloned Versions of this template, the file/paths below will be relative
   to your parent project directory and as such, should be all set to your new: ~.../your-simple-document-project/org-templates/~ directory...

   *SETUPFILE:* ~simple-doc-setup.org~ is for LaTeX Export Configurations 
              to produce a Simple Document styled PDF

   *SETUPFILE:* ~default-tags.org~ is where tags are set for this project...

              If you need to change the category, do it in your cloned version
              of default-tags.org...  If you rename default-tags.org file from
              "default" to something more specific, you will need to change the
              ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/default-tags.org~ line below to reflect
              your new file name as well...  You may change any of the tags except
              important ones to what ever you wish... Read the *:README:* drawer
              within the file for more information...

              The Existing Tags are useful for most situations within
              this context, and some of the tags MUST ALWAYS be defined
              for this LaTeX publishing system to work correctly...

              This file may be used by other ~.org~ files within this
              Master Folder... If you need to customize them specifically
              for this ~.org~ file alone, you should copy and rename:
              ~default-tags.org~ and modify your renamed copy instead...
              
              If you do this, you will ALSO need to change the
              ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/default-tags.org~
              directive below to reflect your changed file name...

              /(change the name from/ ~default-tags.org~ /to another name/
              /and-or replace some (but NOT ALL) of the tags within/
              /to your own tags... see instructions inside the file)/

:LATEST_UPDATE:
  <2023-10-18 Wed>

  =YOU MAY REMOVE This Drawer= from your own clones of this template if
  it is bothering you... This drawer is used for HAP Modular Emacs
  DOC TEMPLATES housekeeping...

  =HOWEVER= you may also use it for the same purpose to keep your existing
  Modular Emacs based org documents in sync with the latest updates of the
  template they were created from...
  
  =If you do wish to do the same... Read On Below...=
  
  - =INTERNAL USE Instructions:= /(END USERS SKIP THIS BULLET)/

    This bullet is not for end users... This is /"Note to Self"/ stuff...

      + [X] =MASTER TEMPLATE ONLY= *Keep The Above Timestamp Up To Date:*

          DO THIS ALWAYS, JUST AFTER YOU UPDATE THIS TEMPLATE... DON'T FORGET!
          /(i.e., BOILERPLATE content and :README: meta data)/
  
  - =PUBLIC USE Instructions:= /(FOR CLONES OF THIS TEMPLATE)/

      + [ ] *FOR NEWLY CREATED CLONES:*

          - [ ] =Change this= *:LATEST_UPDATE:* =drawer title:= /(within clones only)/

               Change it to: *:LATEST_TEMPLATE_UPDATE:*

          - [ ] *REMOVE INTERNAL USE INSTRUCTIONS*

               Remove the main =INTERNAL USE Instructions:= bullet above...
               That bullet is only relevant to the TEMPLATE, /(not clones)/

      + [ ] *FOR ALREADY EXISTING PROJECTS*:

          - [ ] *COMPARE the TIMESTAMPS between THIS TEMPLATE and your PROJECT:*

              The BOILERPLATE content and meta data within CLONES of this
              TEMPLATE will get out of sync after a while due to Harmonic
              Alchemy Modular Emacs version updates etc... Some NEW features
              or HEADINGS may have been added that make sense to be added
              to your existing project /(originally a clone of this)/
        
              Use the ABOVE timestamp /(within the TEMPLATE and your CLONE)/
              to see if the clone's BOILERPLATE content needs to be updated
              /(brought into sync with its template - MERGE)/ and then perform
              any needed merging/replacing of BOILERPLATE and/or meta data.
              /(e.g, *:README:* drawers, etc. even this drawer)/

          - [ ] *Keep ABOVE timestamp within CLONES of this template UP TO DATE:*

              =AFTER Completing Above MERGE Step= and your clone's BOILERPLATE
              content has been brought up to date /(i.e. in sync)/ with its
              TEMPLATE... Then update the timestamp ABOVE... /(WITHIN YOUR CLONE)/
              to record the date of its last sync status...

:READ_ME_FIRST:
=Instructions:= /(How to Install & Use This Template)/

To use *HAP_PDF-Example-Figure-Template.org* for your own projects, perform the following steps: 

/Use the org-mode Checkboxes to Help You Keep Track of Progress/

1) [ ] *Clone a Copy of This File:*

      Put your clone where you normally organize your writing projects.
      (most likely with a larger Book Doc that you wish to export short
      figures, or examples, as stand alone PDF files...

      *Place it within its own MASTER* *FOLDER* /(or within an existing /project
      MASTER FOLDER that contains other cloned .org Templates allready set up)/

      Existing MASTER FOLDERS contain other files for other projects as well as
      the SETUPFILES and MEDIA required by this Simple Document .org file...

      =Note:= If you put this file within other Project's existing MASTER FOLDERS
            that contain existing ~.org~ files /(cloned from other HAP_Doc-Skeleton/
            /template files)/ Pay CLOSE Attention to the Second and Third bullets
            under Step 3 below to decide the correct action to take during
            those steps...

            =Do NOT OVERWRITE ANY PRE-EXISTING FILES or FOLDERS!!!=

            =OTHERWISE:= If this is a Brand NEW Project, name its NEW MASTER FOLDER
                       to reflect your Simple Document's title...
                       /(i.e., what you renamed this .org file to)/...

      =OTHER Files/Folders May also be placed Within your MASTER FOLDERS...=

2) [ ] =Sketch Out Your Example or Figure=

      Create a New Example if this is being done from scratch, or, copy the
      example from a Larger .org Book Project if that is your intention...

      Do the rest of the steps /(below)/ after getting this first part done...

3) [ ] =Finish Setting Up The Rest Of This Project LATER= [0/12]

    - [ ] *Change Title of :LATEST_UPDATE: drawer ABOVE:*

         AFTER Cloning, Change *:LATEST_UPDATE:* drawer title ABOVE
         /(within your clone, NOT the Original!)/ to *:LATEST_TEMPLATE_UPDATE:*
         AND Follow Instructions within it...

    - [ ] *Copy/Clone:* ~./media~ /(and contents)/ *to your new project's MASTER FOLDER:*

         =NOTE:= Most Likely you are placing this file within an EXISTING
               org-mode PROJECT...  If that is the case =SKIP THIS STEP=...
               /i.e. Do NOT Copy/Clone a NEW ./media folder.../
               
         =OTHERWISE:= Do copy this folder...

               If the example or figure you are making is new and NOT part of a
               larger work, /(BOOK, or longer Paper)/, then you DO want to copy
               this folder and all files within, to this Example's Parent folder.
               
               Copy this directory /(into your master folder as a sibling of
               this file).../
               
               Any external documents or images referenced by your book
               project should be placed within this ~./media/~ directory...

               ANY external links, images, within the boilerplate examples of
               this template may be used as examples for getting your own
               images, and external attachments linked properly...

               This single ~./media~ directory serves media and external attachments 
               for this and other Modular Emacs Document TEMPLATE ~.org~ files that
               may exist within this MASTER FOLDER now or in the future...

         =Note:= You DON'T need to copy the ~./auto/~ directory... That directory
               will be automatically created by *AuxTex* the first time you export
               this ~.org~ file to ~.PDF~...

    - [ ] *Copy/Clone:* ~./org-templates~ *to your project's MASTER FOLDER:*

         =WARNING!:= To avoid overwriting existing files, DO NOT COPY this
                   ~./org-templates~ to your MASTER FOLDER IF ONE ALREADY EXISTS!

                   But DO follow the rest of this step so you will know what you
                   should do...

                   =OTHERWISE For MASTER FOLDERS that DO NOT already have one:=
                   *Copy this NEW directory to your simple document's MASTER FOLDER*
                   /(i.e., as a sibling/ /of this book's .org file).../

         =Note:= SETUPFILES Within this new or existing directory are called out
               and included by this ~HAP_PDF-Example-Figure-Template.org~ file...
               /(within the file header above)/

         =WARNING:= There may ALREADY be an ~org-templates~ directory existing within
                  your MASTER FOLDER! In that case you will need to merge:
                  ~simple-doc-setup.org~ AND ~default-tags.org~ /(contained within)/
                  into your existing copies of them instead...       

                  =YOU WON'T WANT TO OVERRITE EXISTING FILES= within this 
                  directory you are already using, /(and modified!!!)/
                  but you may need to update existing files you are NOT
                  using currently if/when you DO start using them...

         Other SETUPFILES within this directory are intended to be used by
         other document style project templates and are not needed for this:
         *PDF Example Figure Template* document... You may remove the extra
         files if you wish... 

         =HOWEVER:= If you decide to clone another ~HAP_<book-template>.org~
                  file into this project folder it will pick up its
                  associated SETUPFILES automatically because this folder
                  already exists! Consider this case if/when you decide
                  to delete other UNUSED SETUPFILES... They are small text
                  files not really bothering you...

                  /(YOU MAY NEED THEM LATER DEPENDING ON YOUR CASE)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TITLE:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

          Change to: /"your Example or Figure (excerpt) Title"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

          Change to: /"your-Example-Title.pdf"/
          This will be the file name(s) produced during export thence forward
          /(including auto generated files: .tex, etc...)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Copyright © 2022:~ *directive top of this file:*

          Change to: /"Copyright © your info here"/ You are the copyright
          owner of your own documents created from clones of these master
          templates... /(but these MASTER Template Files are to stay under/
          /Harmonic Alchemy Productions copyright. Any Attribution to me/
          /for the template structure of your published docs will be/
          /appreciated... but unnecessary... Thanks! ;-)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+AUTHOR:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

          Change to: /"your NAME"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+EMAIL:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

          Change to: /"your EMAIL"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Created:~ *TIMESTAMP at the top of this file:*

          Put your cursor on the TIMESTAMP: /i.e.,/ <2022-10-05 Wed>
          and type: ~C-c . . RETURN~ The TIMESTAMP will update to NOW.

          =LEAVE THIS DATE ALONE after Setting It The FIRST Time=

          This Date reflects the time/date that you first created this
          new document It should NEVER change after that...

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Last Published:~ *TIMESTAMP at Publish Time:*

          =Don't Change This UNTIL You Have Actually Exported This File=
          /(e.g., as a PDF or HTML, etc. and have PUBLISHED it publically somewhere)/
          
          Until that publishing time comes leave it alone as:
          ~<NOT Published>~
          
          As soon as this is published or re-published, Replace the
          <unpublished> placeholder with a REAL TIMESTAMP by typing:
          ~C-c . . RETURN~ The new Last Published: <TIMESTAMP> will
          appear in place... Do this EVERY time you publish or update
          an existing publishing... /(this will help you keep track)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+FILETAGS:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

          Add your own tags that match the context of your document...

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+DESCRIPTION:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

          Compose Your Example or Figure's Description as a short paragraph
          here... and then use that to change the directive above...

4) *Purpose of the:* ~./auto/~ *Directory:* /(you do not need to copy this)/

   This is or will-be an auto generated folder where your output ~.PDF~ 
   files are created and placed during LaTeX export. You DO NOT need 
   to copy this folder as it is auto generated during org-mode LaTeX 
   processing...

   LaTeX processing will not delete any prior files contained here... 
   Some of them will be updated, but will have backups...  Any files 
   you place within this folder will NOT be lost, unless you delete 
   them... This folder is a good place to store other temporary files 
   you may be creating, generating.. etc...

5) *Purpose of the:* ~./org-templates~  *Directory:*

   The files in here are automatically linked and included within this
   template. You don't need to change those settings unless you wish to
   customize the already customized tags, and export options.

   Things are currently set up correctly to produce a simple PDF file
   containing a single heading with your Example or Figure as sub items...
   The category is all set as well... But you can and may modify the
   original files to fit your needs...

   Other SETUPFILES within this directory are intended to be used by
   other document style project templates and are not needed for this:
   ~HAP_PDF-Example-Figure-Template.org~ Document... You may remove the
   extra files if you wish... 

   =HOWEVER:= If you decide to clone another ~HAP_<book-template>.org~
            file into this project folder it will pick up its
            associated SETUPFILES automatically because this folder
            already exists! Consider this case if/when you decide
            to delete other UNUSED SETUPFILES... They are small text
            files not really bothering you...

            /(YOU MAY NEED THEM LATER DEPENDING ON YOUR CASE)/

            =AND= You won't want to OVERRITE existing files within this 
                directory you are already using, /(and modified!!!)/
                but you may need to update existing files you are NOT
                using currently if/when you DO start using them...

   The DEFAULT Tags defined for all project templates are useful for
   most situations and SOME tags are ALWAYS to be defined for this
   LaTeX publishing system to work.

   /Change the SETUPFILE name ABOVE and within this directory from/
   ~default-tags.org~ /to another name and-or replace some -BUT NOT ALL-/
   /of the tags within to your own tags... see instructions inside the/
   /file.../

6) [ ] =Export/Publish to PDF File:=

       The *In-Buffer Settings* specified by the SETUPFILES above will 
       get this file looking good when exported as a Simple PDF file.  
       Once you have your project directory all set up as above you
       are ready to export your first PDF as a test run...

         *Issue the following Emacs command:*

            ~M-x org-latex-export-to-pdf~

         *OR* If You Enabled *Xah-Fly-Keys* /"Command Mode"/ Try Shortcut:

            ~SPACE e p~

         *OR Export to OTHER Formats:* /(not usefull for this template)/

            ~C-c C-e~

            /(a pop-up will show allowing you to choose export method)/

       After *AucTeX* is done parsing/compiling etc., new files named:

            ~HAP_PDF-Example-Figure-Template.pdf~
            -and-
            ~HAP_PDF-Example-Figure-Template.tex~ 

       /(or the name you changed it to located at the top of this file)/
       will appear within the same directory as this file... 

       Subsequent repeated calls to the above command will overwrite your
       existing ~.pdf~ -and- ~.tex~ files! /(make backups first if needed!)/ You
       could use the ~./auto/~ directory for backups...

       =If you chose the last option above= LaTeX will output files with other
       extensions for those other output formats...

       =If YOU EXPERIENCE LaTeX ERRORS:= *Consult Buffer:* ~*Org PDF LaTeX Output*~

7) [ ] =Handling Images=

   Some Images may render too large or too small to fit on a page
   of an exported version of this file... This is easy do fix within
   your content on an image by image basis...
      
   Use *LaTeX* and/or *HTML* attributes as follows on the images that need
   to be a different size...

   =Example:=
      
       #+CAPTION: Example larger size .png file 
       #+NAME:  example:00001
       #+attr_html: :width 600px
       #+attr_latex: :width 100px
      [[./media/lavender-banner.png]]



=These Instructions Were Last Modified:= <2023-06-01 Thu>

There are no plans to add any other eBook formats to this Simple
*EXAMPLE or FIGURE* template... It is an entirely self contained project
with special emphasis on proper rendering of Tables, Images, and Graphs...

* NEW Figure A /(COMMANDEER This First One)/                           :export:
<<FIG_a>>
:README:

   =Usage:= *This is an EXAMPLE FIGURE or EXAMPLE To Be Commandeered*

   - [ ] =This item is BOILERPLATE=

        Use this FIGURE A is BOILERPLATE intended to be commandeered to
        compose your FIRST Main Topic. It is only here published in order
        for the TEMPLATE to show something in its body as an exported PDF...

        Keep This Item set to ~:export:~ and leave it that way after you have
        commandeered it...

   - [ ] =Commandeer This Item and use it:=

        =COMMANDEER= This item /(changing the title etc.)/ as the
        MAIN TITLE of one or more Examples or Figures...
        If more than one example or figure, use the sub-headings below,
        otherwise remove them and keep this one level deep...

        The structure of this BOILERPLATE is all set up for 
        you allowing you to immediately begin writing and everything will
        work as expected...

        Rename *Figure A:* to a *Unique Title* and remove /(COMMANDEER - etc...)/
        from the end, in order to commandeer the entire item for your needs...

   - [ ] =Change The Anchor Link=

        Change the anchor /(directly under the heading)/ to match your new
        Example or Figure's title name...

        =Note:= I created the following convention for making unique
              anchors within ALL of these HAP_Doc-Skeleton.org
              Template files.

              The anchor ~PREFIX_~ is there to match the named sections
              of a book or document project defined as a standard
              across ALL of these HAP_Document-Skeleton.org Template
              files... This will help keep your anchors unique, and
              also add an extra *KM* dimension of *category* to them...

              It would be wise to follow this convention when you
              create anchors elsewhere within ALL of your document
              Projects created from HAP Modular Emacs Document
              Skeleton Template files...

              If you wish to change all of this, go ahead and do
              what ever you want... For simplicity's sake, follow
              the instructions below... /(there are automatic ways/
              /to create links and anchors within org-mode... I/
              /prefer to do it manually... The alternate is a mess/
              /IMHO)/

        Leave ~FIG_~ as the anchor's prefix... /(as in boilerplate above).../
        Use dashes to connect words /(all lower case)/ from your title...

        The anchor above may be used to link to this Figure or Example
        from other documents which need to reference it...

        /(which may or may not be published as links within the exported PDFs)/

   - [ ] =Replace ALL BOILERPLATE Content Under The Figure A Heading=

        *Add Your Content:* Add your Lists, Tables, Figures, Images, etc...

        =Keep the Structure Of MAIN FIGURE HEADING INTACT:=

        Anything you do under the *MAIN Figure HEADING* Level will be
        automatically handled during export...

        =Note:= Sub headings with unique Anchors are included for your use
              and if you commandeer those sub-headings be sure to change
              the anchors to match your new renamed sub-headings...
              
              /Make them Unique! USE the BOILERPLATE EXAMPLES to lean how/
              /to get these looking good when exported to a PDF file.../
:END:

Use Subheadings below if needed, or REMOVE them... These templates are ALSO
available in the Meta: Binder...  They are actually only here to give exported PDF some body, and for me to test how different export formats render...

The SETUPFILE for this .org file uses package: "leadsheets"
Package leadsheets provides: music symbols and chords...

Leadsheets makes the music symbol font provided by MusiXTeX available as text font and then uses it to define the following symbols:

$\sharp$ $\doublesharp$ $\flat$ $\doubleflat$ $\natural$ $\trebleclef$ $\altoclef$ $\bassclef$ $\meterC$ $\allabreve$ $\meter{12}{8}$ $\wholerest$ $\halfrest$ $\quarterrest$ $\eighthrest$ $\sixteenthrest$ $\Break$ $\normalbar$ $\leftrepeat$ $\rightrepeat$ $\leftrightrepeat$ $\doublebar$ $\stopbar$

B$\flat$ A$\natural$  C$\sharp$


NOW Let's typeset some chords:

$\writechord{Bb7(#9)}$ $\writechord{Bbb6}$ $\writechord{C#7(b9)}$ $\writechord{C##13}$

*** Sub Heading T /(template with tables - rename this)/
<<FIG-A_subhead-t>>

**** Basics:
<<FIG-A-SUBH-T_basics>>

The following are example Tables you can use /(with some instructions)/ Use what you need and Remove the rest...

- *Simple Basic*

   | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
   |--------+--------+--------+--------|
   |        |        |        |        |

- *A Bit More than Basic*

  | My Column 1 | My Column 2 | Last Column |
  |-------------+-------------+-------------|
  |          42 | foo         | bar         |
  |          23 | baz         | abcdefg     |
  |-------------+-------------+-------------|
  |          65 |             |             |

**** Column Allignment:
<<FIG-A-SUBH-T_col-allign>>

- *Columns are automatically aligned by default as such:*

   /Number-rich Columns to the Right/

   /String-rich Columns to the Left/

- *Override Automatic Alignment:*

   /If you want to override the automatic alignment 
   use:/ ~<r>~, ~<c>~ or ~<l>~.

    #+CAPTION: Table with aligned columns
   |              |     <c>      | <l>          |
   | 1            |      2       | 3            |
   | Right        |    Center    | Left         |
   | xxxxxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxxxxx |

**** Header rows  & Row Borders
<<FIG-A-SUBH-T_head-row>>

- *You can create tables with a header row:* 

   /(by using a horizontal line of dashes to separate/ 
    /it from the rest of the table)/ 

   *Like This:*

   #+CAPTION: Table with an header row
   | Name of column 1 | Name of column 2 | Name of column 3 |
   |------------------+------------------+------------------|
   | Top left         | Top middle       |                  |
   |                  |                  | Right            |
   | Bottom left      | Bottom middle    |                  |

**** Vertical Borders:
<<FIG-Z-SUBH-T_vertical-borders>>

You can create tables with vertical & horizontal borders around groups of cells by using a combination of horizontal (header row) lines, and the following notation above the table...

=Table with Horizontal and Vertical Borders around Groups:=

REM *****************************************************************************
REM ************************* SUB PROGRAM: GetSetCRoot **************************
REM
REM This Program, (first step to operate the slide rule) gets the selected Chord
REM ROOT INDEX from currently selected Chord Root Radio Button...
REM This INDEX is the Chord Root's position within the REF C12 SCALE...
REM The computed root index value is put into a Named "C ROOT" CELL on the sheet.
REM The REF C12 "Note Symbol" for this index is put into another Named Cell just
REM below it... The ROOT's INDEX value is also saved to Global Var: lROOT...
REM lROOT's value does not change until this Sub Program is called again...
REM NOTHING ELSE MUST CHANGE IT'S VALUE!
REM
REM WARNING: DON'T USE GLOBAL lROOT UNTIL AFTER CALLING THIS SUB Program!!!
REM          AND DONT RUN any of the FUNCTIONS in this Module before running
REM          this Sub Program either... (they ALL DEPEND on this GLOBAL Var
REM          being set.  Also This Program must ONLY be run as a result of
REM          the ChordRoot RADIO BUTTON array changing STATE...
REM	  (i.e., radio button event driven only)

   REM Get the Chord Root Radio Buttons as OBJECT... 
   REM Then Get the Chord Root Radio Buttons Group Control By Name
   REM These radio buttons belong to group: "CRootRadButnGroup"
   oRadBtn = oFormCtl.GetbyName("CRootRadButn")
   oFormCtl.getGroupByName("CRootRadButnGroup", oGroupCtl)
  
   REM Get the current STATE from selected CHordRootButton:
   REM There are 12 button members in oGroupCtl (0-11)...
   REM oGroupCtl (radio button array object) has a 1:1 relation
   REM with aC12_REF_SCALE Array... i.e. their index positions
   REM and corresponding Note Name values are equivalent...
   For lIndex = LBound(oGroupCtl) to UBound(oGroupCtl)
   
      oRadBtn = oGroupCtl(lIndex)

      REM Is this the ACTIVE Radio Button?
      If oRadBtn.State <> 0 Then
         REM YES - THIS IS ACTIVE Radio Button - Set and Save Data
	 
         REM Set Chord root (INDEX) NAMED CELL to current lIndex (integer)

         REM Set Chord Root (SYMBOL) NAMED CELL to oRadBtn's
         REM Note name LABEL from ACTIVE Radio Button Object...
         oCRootSymbolCell.setString(oRadBtn.Label)

         REM Save Active CHordRootButton's Index

         lROOT = lIndex
      End If

   REM lROOT is now SET for further operations until this sub program is called
   REM again to change it... NOTHING ELSE SHOULD DO THIS! (otherwize your radio
   REM buttons are forced to become liars! - Nobody hates anything worse than
   REM a calculator that lies! (or a compiler LOL!) Have you ever spent WEEKS
   REM debugging your code only to finally discover your compiler was lying to
   REM you? APPLE... Talking to you! That was YOUR BAD! COMPILERS MUST NOT LIE!

   REM NOW the lROOT is set it is TIME TO LOAD the CHORDMODE Named Range starting
   REM with lROOT SYMBOL IN "0" CELL... All the code for this is contained in Sub

** 📃 About:

The *Templates:* section provides skeleton templates for use within this document.  These /"meta-sections"/ do not show up in final published docs, /(e.g., .pdf or web etc)/...

Any sub heading under the "*Templates:"* group can be utilized by copy-pasting the collapsed heading into your existing document sections (i.e., making a clone anywhere you need to create a new section based on the template's structure)... 

In some cases you may have to adjust the heading level of your pasted content... To do that place your cursor at the very beginning of the pasted heading /(completely collapsed)/ and type: ~M-S-<right or left arrow>~  Using the Shift key changes the hierarchy level of the cloned heading as well as the relative sub level headings it may contain... if it is not collapsed first you only change the level of the selected heading but none of the headings below /(no matter if they are currently sub headings)/.

The intent of these templates are to save lots of time starting up a new document or to quickly develop a new idea.  Lets see if it helps. :trollface:

** 📄 Instructions:

=Treat Anything Found Within This Section as a Potential TEMPLATE= which may be used repeatedly as you write your Document Above...

Change the Name, titles, and/or headings of Your Cloned Template to a specific title required within your document...
