#+DESCRIPTION: Short and sweet README with attached Log Notebook for any project or repository that needs such a thing... Great FOR GITHUB PAGES!!! The ORG TOC renders in Github nicely!! This ORG file is NOT intended to be exported with LaTeX... This template's sole purpose is to provide a traditional README startup document, for you to use, (usually contained with source code, but there are many other applications)... THIS is NOT for a BOOK, or PDF, or anything else that may need to be typeset for publishing... The only intended export option for this file is HTML (for websites - BUT GitHub Renders this file AS IS nicely)... Custom tailor this to fit your needs. Change the tags in default-tags.org (referenced below) as well.. to fit your needs... Enjoy!

#+BEGIN_COMMENT

=Setup TAGS:=

   For Cloned Versions of this template, the file/paths below will be relative
   to your parent project directory and as such, should be all set to your new: ~.../your_README.org_File's/org-templates/~ directory...

   *SETUPFILE:* ~default-tags.org~ is where tags are defined for this project...
              If you need to change the category, do it in your cloned version
              of default-tags.org...  If you rename default-tags.org file from
              "default" to something more specific, you will need to change the
              ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/default-tags.org~ line below to reflect
              your new file name as well...  You may change any of the tags except
              important ones to what ever you wish... Read the *:README:* drawer
              within the file for more information...

              The Existing Tags are useful for most situations within
              this context, and some of the tags MUST ALWAYS be defined
              for this LaTeX publishing system to work correctly...

              This file may be used by other ~.org~ files within this
              Master Folder... If you need to customize them specifically
              for this ~.org~ file alone, you should copy and rename:
              ~default-tags.org~ and modify your renamed copy instead...
              
              If you do this, you will ALSO need to change the
              ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/default-tags.org~
              directive below to reflect your changed file name...

              /(change the name from/ ~default-tags.org~ /to another name/
              /and-or replace some (but NOT ALL) of the tags within/
              /to your own tags... see instructions inside the file)/

:LATEST_UPDATE:
  <2023-10-18 Wed>

  =YOU MAY REMOVE This Drawer= from your own clones of this template if
  it is bothering you... This drawer is used for HAP Modular Emacs
  DOC TEMPLATES housekeeping...

  =HOWEVER= you may also use it for the same purpose to keep your existing
  Modular Emacs based org documents in sync with the latest updates of the
  template they were created from...
  
  =If you do wish to do the same... Read On Below...=
  
  - =INTERNAL USE Instructions:= /(END USERS SKIP THIS BULLET)/

    This bullet is not for end users... This is /"Note to Self"/ stuff...

     + [X] =MASTER TEMPLATE ONLY= *Keep The Above Timestamp Up To Date:*

         DO THIS ALWAYS, JUST AFTER YOU UPDATE THIS TEMPLATE... DON'T FORGET!
         /(i.e., BOILERPLATE content and :README: meta data)/

  - =PUBLIC USE Instructions:= /(FOR CLONES OF THIS TEMPLATE)/

      + [ ] *FOR NEWLY CREATED CLONES:*

          - [ ] =Change this= *:LATEST_UPDATE:* =drawer title:= /(within clones only)/

               Change it to: *:LATEST_TEMPLATE_UPDATE:*

          - [ ] *REMOVE INTERNAL USE INSTRUCTIONS*

               Remove the main =INTERNAL USE Instructions:= bullet above...
               That bullet is only relevant to the TEMPLATE, /(not clones)/

      + [ ] *FOR ALREADY EXISTING PROJECTS*:

          - [ ] *COMPARE the TIMESTAMPS between THIS TEMPLATE and your PROJECT:*

              The BOILERPLATE content and meta data within CLONES of this
              TEMPLATE will get out of sync after a while due to Harmonic
              Alchemy Modular Emacs version updates etc... Some NEW features
              or HEADINGS may have been added that make sense to be added
              to your existing project /(originally a clone of this)/
        
              Use the ABOVE timestamp /(within the TEMPLATE and your CLONE)/
              to see if the clone's BOILERPLATE content needs to be updated
              /(brought into sync with its template - MERGE)/ and then perform
              any needed merging/replacing of BOILERPLATE and/or meta data.
              /(e.g, *:README:* drawers, etc. even this drawer)/

          - [ ] *Keep ABOVE timestamp within CLONES of this template UP TO DATE:*

              =AFTER Completing Above MERGE Step= and your clone's BOILERPLATE
              content has been brought up to date /(i.e. in sync)/ with its
              TEMPLATE... Then update the timestamp ABOVE... /(WITHIN YOUR CLONE)/
              to record the date of its last sync status...

:END:
:READ_ME_FIRST:
=Instructions:= /(How to Install & Use This Template)/

To use *HAP_README-Doc-Skeleton.org* Org-Mode README Doc Template for your own projects, =Perform The Following Steps:= 

/Use the org-mode Checkboxes to Help You Keep Track of Progress/

1) [ ] *Clone a Copy of This File:*

      Put your clone within any existing writing or coding project's MASTER
      FOLDER or anywhere you need to have a simple NON-PUBLISHING README.org
      file associated with source code or other files...

      Existing MASTER FOLDERS contain other files for other projects as well
      as the SETUPFILES and MEDIA required by this README.org file...

      =Note:= If you put this file within other Project's existing MASTER FOLDERS
            that contain existing ~.org~ files /(cloned from other HAP_Doc-Skeleton/
            /template files)/ Pay CLOSE Attention to Steps 3 & 4 below to decide
            the correct action to take during those steps...

            =Do NOT OVERWRITE ANY PRE-EXISTING FILES or FOLDERS!!!=

            =OTHERWISE:= If this is a Brand NEW Project, name its NEW MASTER FOLDER to
                       reflect what this README Doc is about...

      =OTHER Files/Folders May also be placed Within your MASTER FOLDERS...=

2) [ ] =Start Composing your README Content NOW:=

      =NOTE:= You are most likely doing this because you have a project that
            needs a README File included as the Start Here Document for that
            project... Therefore... as soon as you are done with the first
            steps above, =STOP= and immediately begin composing your README
            Content within the: *📖 README* Binder =NOW=...

      =Add Sub headings below for your README as needed...=

      *btw*, if you Have *Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs* fully installed and
      have enabled the ~Xah-Fly-Keys~ module, you can quickly and easily
      insert your own /:README:/ drawers for your own purposes by typing:
      ~SPACE e r~ on an empty line while in command mode... Type those two
      keys, and the drawer is created for you automatically and opened...

3) [ ] =Finish Setting Up The Rest Of This Project LATER= [0/12]

    - [ ] *Change Title of :LATEST_UPDATE: drawer ABOVE:*

         AFTER Cloning, Change *:LATEST_UPDATE:* drawer title ABOVE
         /(WITHIN YOUR CLONE, NOT THE ORIGINAL!)/ to *:LATEST_TEMPLATE_UPDATE:*
         AND Follow Instructions within it...

    - [ ] *Copy/Clone:* ~./media~ /(and contents)/ *to your new project's MASTER FOLDER:*

         Copy this directory /(into your MASTER FOLDER as a sibling of this file).../ 
         Any external documents or images referenced by your *README Document* 
         should be placed within this ~./media/~ directory...

         All external links, images, within the boilerplate examples of this
         template may be used as examples for getting your own images, and 
         external attachments linked properly...  

         This single ~./media~ directory will serve media and external attachments 
         for this and other Modular Emacs Document TEMPLATE ~.org~ files that may
         exist within this MASTER FOLDER now or in the future...

         /(IF/WHEN THEY /WERE/ARE COPIED HERE)/

         =Note:=  You DON'T need to copy the ~./auto/~ directory... That directory
                may be automatically created by *AuxTeX* when exporting other ~.org~
                files based on *Modular Emacs* TEMPLATES but =NOT= from this ~.org~
                file which is not set up for exporting to ~.PDF~...

    - [ ] *Copy/Clone:* ~./org-templates~ /(and all contents)/ *to your MASTER FOLDER:*

         =WARNING!:= To avoid overwriting existing files, DO NOT COPY this
                   ~./org-templates~ to your MASTER FOLDER IF ONE ALREADY EXISTS!

                   But DO follow the rest of this step so you will know what you
                   should do...

                   =OTHERWISE For MASTER FOLDERS that DO NOT already have one:=
                   *Copy this NEW directory to serve as your:
                   =NEW Readme Doc's MASTER FOLDER=
                   /(i.e., as a sibling/ /of this README.org file).../

         =Note:= ONLY ONE SETUPFILE Within this directory is called out and
               included by this ~README.org~ file /(within the file header above)/

         =WARNING:= There may ALREADY be an ~org-templates~ directory existing
                  within your MASTER FOLDER! In that case you will need to
                  merge: ~default-tags.org~ /(contained within)/ into your
                  existing copy of it instead...       

                  =YOU WON'T WANT TO OVERRITE EXISTING FILES= within this 
                  directory IF you are already using it for OTHER .org Files,
                  /(and they were modified!!!)/ but you may need to update
                  existing files you are NOT using currently if/when you
                  DO start using them...

     Other SETUPFILES within this directory are intended to be used by
     other document style project templates and are not needed for this:
     ~README.org~ Document... You may remove the extra files if you wish... 

     =HOWEVER:= If you decide to clone another ~HAP_<book-template>.org~
              file into this project folder it will pick up its
              associated SETUPFILES automatically because this folder
              already exists! Consider this case if/when you decide
              to delete other UNUSED SETUPFILES... They are small text
              files not really bothering you...

              /(YOU MAY NEED THEM LATER DEPENDING ON YOUR CASE)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TITLE:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

         Change to: /"your Readme Document's REAL Project Title"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Copyright © 2022:~ *directive top of this file:*

         Change to: /"Copyright © your info here"/ You are the copyright
         owner of your own documents created from clones of these master
         templates... /(but these MASTER Template Files are to stay under/
         /Harmonic Alchemy Productions copyright. Any Attribution to me/
         /for the template structure of your published docs will be/
         /appreciated... but unnecessary... Thanks! ;-)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+AUTHOR:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

         Change to: /"your NAME"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+EMAIL:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

         Change to: /"your EMAIL"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Created:~ *TIMESTAMP at the top of this file:*

         Put your cursor on the TIMESTAMP: /i.e.,/ <2022-10-05 Wed>
         and type: ~C-c . . RETURN~ The TIMESTAMP will update to NOW.

         =LEAVE THIS DATE ALONE after Setting It The FIRST Time=

         This Date reflects the time/date that you first created this
         new document It should NEVER change after that...

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Last Published:~ *TIMESTAMP at Publish Time:*

          =Don't Change This UNTIL You have completed some MAJOR Release=
          of the files or code that this ~README.org~ doc refers to and this
          README reflects the status of that MAJOR UPDATE
          /(e.g., as published somewhere, in a public repository etc...)/

          Until that publishing time comes leave it alone as:
          ~<NOT Published>~
          
          As soon as this is published as part of a major release, etc,
          Replace the <unpublished> placeholder with a REAL TIMESTAMP by typing:
          ~C-c . . RETURN~ The new Last Published: <TIMESTAMP> will appear in
          place... Do this ANY time you have completed some major update, have
          published that update and this file needs to reflect that update...
          /(this will help you keep track)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+FILETAGS:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

         Add your own tags that match the context of your README document...

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+DESCRIPTION:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

         Compose your ~README~ Doc's Description as a short paragraph here...
         and then use that to change the directive above...

4) *Purpose of the:* ~./org-templates~  *Directory:*

    The files in here are automatically linked and included within
    this template. You don't need to change those settings unless you
    wish to customize the already customized tags...

    /They are allready set up correctly for the General Documents genre,/
    /and the category is all set as well... But you can and may modify/
    /the original files to fit your needs.../
       
    Other SETUPFILES within this directory are intended to be used by
    other document style project templates and are not needed for this:
    ~README.org~ Document... You may remove the extra files if you wish... 

    =HOWEVER:= If you decide to clone another ~HAP_<book-template>.org~
             file into this project folder it will pick up its
             associated SETUPFILES automatically because this folder
             already exists! Consider this case if/when you decide
             to delete other UNUSED SETUPFILES... They are small text
             files not really bothering you...

             /(YOU MAY NEED THEM LATER DEPENDING ON YOUR CASE)/

             =AND= You won't want to OVERRITE existing files within this 
                 directory you are already using, /(and modified!!!)/
                 but you may need to update existing files you are NOT
                 using currently if/when you DO start using them...

    The DEFAULT Tags defined for all project templates are useful for
    most situations and SOME tags are ALWAYS to be defined for this
    LaTeX publishing system to work.

    /Change the SETUPFILE name ABOVE and within this directory from/
    ~default-tags.org~ /to another name and-or replace some -BUT NOT ALL-/
    /of the tags within to your own tags... see instructions inside the/
    /file.../

5) =This File is NOT SET UP TO BE EXPORTED TO PDF= [0/3]

      You may wish to export OTHER Modular Emacs based .org files within
      this MASTER FOLDER to PDF format however... To do that follow the
      instructions within those .org files

6) *Handling Images:*

   Some Images may render too large or too small to fit on a page
   of an exported version of this file... This is easy do fix within
   your content on an image by image basis...
      
   Use *LaTeX* and/or *HTML* attributes as follows on the images that need
   to be a different size...

   =NOTE:= Within Org-Mode =if you do NOT see images= but instead a LINK
         *USE:* ~C-c~ ~C-x~ ~C-V~ to Toggle back to image view...

   =Example:=
      
       #+CAPTION: Example larger size .png file 
       #+NAME:  example:00001
       #+attr_html: :width 600px
       #+attr_latex: :width 100px
      [[./media/lavender-banner.png]]

=These Instructions Were Last Modified:= <2023-10-18 Wed>

If you experience problems =Please Open an ISSUE At:= https://github.com/harmonicalchemy/modular-emacs/issues
   
Please use Issues to Ask Questions, Report Problems/Bugs etc., and Suggest Ideas for Improvement... =You guys are my Product Managers=  I am only a User of ONE "seat". Other folks UX metrics are sorely needed!! Thanks!

   - *Go To One of the HEADINGS Below:* /(Summary, Details, or Sub Headings)/

      =Punch the Time Clock= At the heading And then begin working on a task related to that Heading... =Your Time IS being Recorded Now= 

   - =Use These Commands:= /as you work to keep track your time.../

      + *Clock IN:* ~C-c C-x C-i~ 

                    /(Begin OR Resume Clocking Current task)/

                    This creates a new :CLOCKING: Time Card Entry just
                    underneath the HEADING...

                    Do this just before starting work on the task... 
                    Be in control of your life!

                    After doing the above, you can go away and do some 
                    work, leaving this heading, log note, etc. to visit 
                    other files and/or work on them etc. The clock will 
                    be recording your time all the while... You will see 
                    in your mode line the elapsed clock time ticking away 
                    as you work on a task /(hopefully related to this clock!)/
                    and NOT Yac Shaving or being sidetracked!!!

      + *RETURN to Clock Heading:* ~C-c C-x C-j~

                        /Go back to the place where you started the clock.../

                        You do this after you have worked on a task for a 
                        while and you need to come back to update the item's
                        info etc., and/or stop the clock before going off to 
                        do something else unrelated to the log entry...

      + *Clock OUT:* ~C-c C-x C-o~ /(to stop clocking your time on task)/

                      This *Finalizes the Time Card Entry* within:
                      ~:CLOCKING:~ /(created earlier when you started the/ 
                      /clock)/...

                      The Clock Entry changes showing start timestamp, end timestamp, and total time worked during this segment...  

                      =Please DON'T Forget= /Like I often do, LOL.../ i.e.,
                      Leaving a clock running all day by accident, or worse,
                      leave it dangling with the file closed only to open it
                      again and get that nasty *Org-Mode Message:* /"What do/
                      /you want to do with this?"/ If you do something like 
                      that you can always come back and directly edit the 
                      clock times by hand to amend them...  After changing 
                      clock times or dates, etc... Whatever...

                      ="Onward We Row Mates... Through the log jam!"=

      + *Update Time Card Entry:* ~C-c C-c~ 

                  This command will change the total time at the end showing 
                  your new calculated time...

                  If you need to go away and do something else before finishing this task, you can do so after clocking out... When you come back simply clock back in again to start another Time Card Entry just as before... The new time card entry will appear above the earlier one within the ~:CLOCKING:~ drawer... When you clock out of this task it will look just like the entry below it with a total time worked tagged on the end...

            When you are all done with a Log Entry use the above key 
            command to mark its Heading *TODO* tag to: *DONE* /(Most of the/ 
            /time this will ALSO clock you out if you are still clocked/ 
            /into the item... But not allways in my experience.../

            marking it DONE... Type: ~C-c C-x C-j~ to check this...
            /(if no running clock it will tell you and place your/
            /cursor at the heading where you LAST CLOCKED OUT)/

      + ~C-c C-x C-q~ *Cancel Current Clock:* /(in case of accident)/

                      This removes currently running clock and forgets 
                      any time accrued or associated with it...

   Also the *Time Card* /displayed above/ each search hit will give more clues by showing important headings you worked on...

   Below is an optional list /(that could also provide links)./ This list could be used to itemize things you worked on, but I personally find it easier to simply write a short one or two line description containing important keywords right here and nothing more. I think that is more useful...

** 📅 2024: 

/Not Here Yet but keep logging... The New Year will be here soon enough!/

=When the New Year Comes Around: RENAME This Heading to the Next YEAR=

=DON'T Clone this Heading...= /(Leave it here as the LAST Top Level Heading before the Meta Binder...  It must stay Titled as the Next Upcoming YEAR)/ 

=After Doing Above:= Create a NEW Top Level Heading with the Current YEAR and Use that to place new Cloned LOG Entry Templates from the Meta Section...

=The Following LaTeX Snippit MUST be placed AFTER All LOG Entries=
/This Starts the BACK MATTER Section of this Log Book (nothing in it yet)/

* 📋 Meta: /(Usage & Templates)/
<<META_Begin-Meta>>

** 📄 Introduction:
:README:
   Use this Standard README /(template)/ as a multi purpose README document
   as a Start Here First Document for any kind of project...

   I stopped using Markdown files for this purpose a few years ago... This makes total sense as *Org-Mode* was designed exclusively for such things! *Markdown* is great for composing content intended for web pages etc.  But =Emacs Org Mode is Vastly Superior as a Publishing Environment=, with many features and power, completely agnostic of final publishing format... Whereas markdown mode excels doing one thing only... Translating author structured plain text into beautiful web pages... /(which is a good thing)/

   I finally bit the long curve bullet and learned Emacs Org Mode /(after many many many years of using Emacs without it!)/ Today, looking back with current knowledge to me is like going back to a /"*Dec VT220* green screen *dumb terminal*"/ after experiencing *X Windows* on a Big *HP-UX Workstation!*

   Yeah, that's a personal story from the past, lol... All you Mac users out there, please realize that your beautiful Apple desktop is in fact an *HP-UX Motif X-Windows widget set clone*!  That's what Steve Jobs believed to be the best X-Windows tool-kit of the day /(when he was building the NeXT computer)/...  So... Yup he copied that! The Applications Doc at the bottom of your screen is a dead giveaway. Hewlet Packard was first to use such UI concepts... /(back before the dawning of the web we loved those HPUX Workstations!)/
:END:

*** Emacs Shorthand Command Key Notation:

The command key conventions used in the instructions below, /(as well as all *Harmonic Alchemy Productions* docs)/, follow *Standard Emacs* command key naming conventions.

Official GNU Emacs documentation uses a shorthand notation to indicate the *Ctrl* key as an upper case *C-* (/with minus appended/). Upper case *M-* (/with minus appended/) is the shorthand notation for the Emacs *META* key...

*** Important Note For Mac Users:

On Mac OS, *Modular Emacs* maps your *Ctrl* key to the *Apple Command* key. Emacs *META* is mapped to both *Alt* and *Ctrl* keys... Outside of Emacs all those keys function normally.  

Therefore, for Mac users, anytime you either see *C-* or *Ctrl* below, use your *Apple Command* key for that when using Modular Emacs.  Anytime you see either *M-* or *META* below, use *Alt* or *Ctrl* keys for that when using Modular Emacs. 

Anytime you are using Modular Emacs following instructions from standard vanilla Emacs docs, keep in mind your ~Ctrl~ and ~META~ keys are not /"standard"/ anymore and you must make a mental translation.  Beyond that, you will be fine following other emacs tutorials etc.  Hey... you Mac enthusiasts are used to that kind of /"being different"/ stuff anyway, right? Being one of /"the rest of us"/ that is... What the heck does that mean anyway? LOL

The above key assignments were done to get the *Emacs C-* key closer to the space bar where it can be activated with your left thumb instead of contorting to get at it with your pinkie finger. This makes using *Xah Fly Keys* even easier to use and less stressful on your fingers...

In the Official Emacs documentation you will commonly find key command notations such as *C-x* or *M-x*... This means: Hold the *Ctrl* /(or *META*)/ key down while typing the *x* key.  

Any time you see this notation, regardless of what key may be connected to it with a dash /(e.g., *C-c*, *M-5*, etc.)/, this means to hold the *Ctrl*-or-*META* key down while you press the other key connected to it with the dash... If you have a command that includes many *C-key* or *M-key* commands in succession simply hold the *Ctrl*-or-*META* key down the entire time you type the other keys and then let go...

If you see other keys alone separated by a space after the *C-x* or *M-x* /(e.g., C-x *d*, M-x *b*, etc.)/ this means to type that key /AFTER/ letting go of the *Ctrl*-or-*META* key...

*Got that?* That's the key notation system we use here... It is all standard Emacs...  The above paragraphs are mostly for the benefit of new Emacs users! And there is more to learn below. If you are an Emacs/Org-Mode veteran please bear with us...

\newpage

*** Org Mode Timestamps and Clocking:

This Template utilizes the default *Org-Mode:* "*C-c* ." command /(i.e., That's Ctrl-c and then type a dot. This Enters a timestamp range at the cursor position)/. The command employs *org-evaluate-time-range* to compute time on task.  This is useful for timesheets etc. 

In addition, the *Log Entry (template)* stores and tracks *Org-Mode :CLOCKING:* entries and displays results in a *Time Card Table* with total time computed... 

Common time clocking commands are defined within the *Log Entry (template)* itself. Any time you need to look up clocking commands, open the *:README:* drawer under the *Log Entry (template)* heading by placing your cursor over it and hitting *TAB*.

Additional commands for using *Org-Mode* with Modular Emacs will be explained here if needed, as well as other *Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs Templates* that get produced in the future...

\newpage

** ❔ HowTo:
:README:
   This README Doc Template is being designed as these docs are being written...  At first much of the design is being done /manually/ while formats, concepts, are tried and tested.  Eventually much of the instructions below will become much simpler as there will be capture templates, and processes in place that replace the need to manually copy/paste things as we are doing initially below...  

   =Please bear with the author/architect as she makes up her mind about how to do things in here...=  *Org-mode, LaTeX options are vast!* Not to mention a sea of extra packages that could be tried out... /I feel like I am re-inventing wheels within rabbit holes!/ lol

*** Create New Log Entry within the *📒 Begin Log:* Binder: [0/4]

- [ ] =Clone:= *NEW* 🗓 *Generic Log Entry* /(from:/ ⎘ *Templates:* /binder)/
  
- [ ] =Select the Heading= /(named above)/ from the ⎘ *Templates:* binder,
    using normal Emacs selection methods. i.e., Type ~t~ key to set the
    mark for selection, /(xah-fly-keys Command/ /Mode)/ or use ~C-SPACE~
    /(normal Emacs)/, and move the point to get the entire heading, and
    all of its contents, but NOTHING else... and copy it...

    =Note:= Before Copying Selected Text, ensure your cursor is at the
          end of it BUT not be part of any items after it... Placing
          your cursor on the first column of the next line will include
          the invisible new-line character which is what you want, but
          any text directly under the cursor on the next line will not
          be copied...  Later, after pasting this text somewhere else,
          your cursor will end up sitting on the first column of a
          blank line under the pasted text. /(exactly as intended)/
          
- [ ] =Complete the Copy Operation= Type ~c~ /(xah-fly-keys Command Mode)/. This 
   will save the selection for pasting later, /(the highlighted text will go/ 
   /back to normal)/... You should have gotten only the Single LOG Entry with
   ALL its contents, BUT nothing else below it...

   =Note:= If you type: "*spacebar t*" /(xah-fly-keys leader key command)/ 
           it will show you the contents of your paste buffer...  You 
           can see the LAST item you copied in there AT THE TOP...  
           To get out of the paste buffer view, type: "*spacebar u*" and 
           it will return you to where you were before...

- [ ] =Paste Cloned LOG Entry:= [0/2]

  - [ ] =Advance cursor= to a blank line just below the LAST Most Recent
      LOG entry under heading *📅 2022* within the *📒 Begin Log:* section,
      and press *ENTER* a couple times to get your cursor on a fresh
      clean line with some extra space above and below it...
      /(Below any previously time stamped entries you may already/
      /have placed)/...

  - [ ] =Press:= ~v~ /(xah-fly-keys Command Mode)/ to paste your cloned Log
      Entry template... If you find out that what you copied also
      included some unwanted text directly below it, no problems...
      Just delete that part now... 

      =Note:= If you accidentally copied one or more previously
            invisible bullets to column one on a blank line they
            will create an invisible "ghost" heading that you will
            now need to delete...
            
            You will know this if you see an org-ellipsis "⤵" symbol
            on a line by itself indicating a heading but no text...
            Simply delete that whole line and it will go away...
            Now you are ready to compose your new log entry...

**** Edit-Compose New LOG Entry:

=Note:= If this is your first time using this log, don't bother cloning a 
      NEW log entry as there is a dummy boilerplate placeholder Log 
      Entry ALREADY in place for you to use...
      /(initially there as an example)/

      The instructions below for modifying the Boilerplate Log Entry, or 
      Editing a new Cloned Log Entry Template are pretty much the same...
      /(differences will be noted in instructions below)/

- [ ] =Place cursor directly on the existing timestamp= of the NEW Log Entry,
    and enter the key binding: ~C-c .~
     /(i.e., press/ ~Ctrl~ /key while holding/ ~c~ /and then type a dot ~.~ /)/
     A date chooser panel will pop up...

- [ ] =Type one more dot:= ~.~ to force the calendar selection to the
    current time and date and then, Press ~ENTER~ to accept your
    choice... /This will update the existing older timestamp with/
    /the current date/time.../ Check to make sure the timestamp was
    properly updated and then move on to the next step... This
    timestamp will not be updated after that.  It records the
    initial time of your new log entry to the Day and time you
    first created it...

- [ ] =You are now ready to start= making entries within your New Log
    Entry... Your timestamp indicates the present, /-and-/ you are
    all set to begin recording timef...

- [ ] =Follow the= ~:README:~ directions within the Time Card section
    contained within your fresh new log entry to learn how to
    /"clock in"/ and /"clock out"/ of your log entry as you work on
    the tasks...

**** Enter New LOG Entry Details:

Two sub headings have been provided for your use /(if you need them)/. However, you may structure your log entries any way you wish.  The two provided headings:  *Summary* and *Details* are simply suggestions to help make your log entries a bit more organized...

The *Summary* heading could be used to log the main executive summary points, /(which you would include in the exported PDF as a report to give to your boss or clients)/. 

Conversely, the *Details* heading could contain a complete, thorough log of your work, which would be excluded from the final PDF report.  Everything under *Details* heading would be extra information that you don't want to bother your clients or boss with /(unless they ask for more detail of course)/. In that case, you will have it all recorded and organized for easy access later if needed...

Place the *:noexport:* tag at the end of any org outline heading to exclude it and all its children from the PDF upon export...  You can add as much detail as you need within these excluded sections without cluttering up your final PDF.  The entire main heading: *How to Use this Template:* is already excluded from the final PDF, so it can be left in and your PDF will only include the *Begin Log:* section...

                    Be in control of your life!

                    After doing the above, you can go away and do some 
                    work, leaving this heading, log note, etc. to visit 
                    other files and/or work on them etc. The clock will 
                    be recording your time all the while... You will see 
                    in your mode line the elapsed clock time ticking away 
                    as you work on a task /(hopefully related to this clock!)/
                    and NOT Yac Shaving or being sidetracked!!!

      + *RETURN to Clock Heading:* ~C-c C-x C-j~

                        /Go back to the place where you started the clock.../

                        You do this after you have worked on a task for a 
                        while and you need to come back to update the item's
                        info etc., and/or stop the clock before going off to 
                        do something else unrelated to the log entry...

      + *Clock OUT:* ~C-c C-x C-o~ /(to stop clocking your time on task)/

                      This *Finalizes the Time Card Entry* within:
                      ~:CLOCKING:~ /(created earlier when you started the/ 
                      /clock)/...

                      The Clock Entry changes showing start timestamp, end timestamp, and total time worked during this segment...  

                      =Please DON'T Forget= /Like I often do, LOL.../ i.e.,
                      Leaving a clock running all day by accident, or worse,
                      leave it dangling with the file closed only to open it
                      again and get that nasty *Org-Mode Message:* /"What do/
                      /you want to do with this?"/ If you do something like 
                      that you can always come back and directly edit the 
                      clock times by hand to amend them...  After changing 
                      clock times or dates, etc... Whatever...

                      ="Onward We Row Mates... Through the log jam!"=

      + *Update Time Card Entry:* ~C-c C-c~ 

                  This command will change the total time at the end showing 
                  your new calculated time...

                  If you need to go away and do something else before finishing this task, you can do so after clocking out... When you come back simply clock back in again to start another Time Card Entry just as before... The new time card entry will appear above the earlier one within the ~:CLOCKING:~ drawer... When you clock out of this task it will look just like the entry below it with a total time worked tagged on the end...

      + *Clock Out & Mark Items Done:* ~C-c C-t~

            When you are all done with a Log Entry use the above key 
            command to mark its Heading *TODO* tag to: *DONE* /(Most of the/ 
            /time this will ALSO clock you out if you are still clocked/ 
            /into the item... But not allways in my experience.../  
            So make sure you are also clocked OUT of an Item After 
            marking it DONE... Type: ~C-c C-x C-j~ to check this...
            /(if no running clock it will tell you and place your/
            /cursor at the heading where you LAST CLOCKED OUT)/

      + ~C-c C-x C-q~ *Cancel Current Clock:* /(in case of accident)/

                      This removes currently running clock and forgets 
                      any time accrued or associated with it...

      + ~C-c C-x C-d~ *Display Clocking Info:* 

                      /This will show elapsed times to the right of headings.../
                      =Warning!= Using this command will CLUTTER ALL the headings
                                within your org file with those timestamps!!!

:README:
   This Summary is mostly to help you find things later when you cannot remember when or where is was done... If you go to the top of this file and expand all headings to show ALL content, then do a search on "~Summary:~" you will be able to quickly scroll through and scan these summaries quickly to find what you were looking for... 

   Also the *Time Card* /displayed above/ each search hit will give more clues by showing important headings you worked on...

   Below is an optional list /(that could also provide links)./ This list could be used to itemize things you worked on, but I personally find it easier to simply write a short one or two line description containing important keywords right here and nothing more. I think that is more useful...
