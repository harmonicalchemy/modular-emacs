#+DESCRIPTION: HAP - Generic Document Skeleton with basic structure for smaller documents that don't require so much planning etc. Great for simple outlines, one page docs, short How-Tos, etc., (easily modified to make reports, charts, etc.)  Publishable as a Simple PDF...

#+BEGIN_COMMENT

=Setup Files:=

   For Cloned Versions of this template, the file/paths below will be relative
   to your parent project directory and as such, should be all set to your new: ~.../your-simple-document-project/org-templates/~ directory...

   *SETUPFILE:* ~simple-doc-setup.org~ is for LaTeX Export Configurations 
              to produce a Simple Document styled PDF

   *SETUPFILE:* ~default-tags.org~ is where tags are set for this project...

              If you need to change the category, do it in your cloned version
              of default-tags.org...  If you rename default-tags.org file from
              "default" to something more specific, you will need to change the
              ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/default-tags.org~ line below to reflect
              your new file name as well...  You may change any of the tags except
              important ones to what ever you wish... Read the *:README:* drawer
              within the file for more information...

              The Existing Tags are useful for most situations within
              this context, and some of the tags MUST ALWAYS be defined
              for this LaTeX publishing system to work correctly...

              This file may be used by other ~.org~ files within this
              Master Folder... If you need to customize them specifically
              for this ~.org~ file alone, you should copy and rename:
              ~default-tags.org~ and modify your renamed copy instead...
              
              If you do this, you will ALSO need to change the
              ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/default-tags.org~
              directive below to reflect your changed file name...

              /(change the name from/ ~default-tags.org~ /to another name/
              /and-or replace some (but NOT ALL) of the tags within/
              /to your own tags... see instructions inside the file)/

:LATEST_UPDATE:
  <2023-02-15 Wed>

  =YOU MAY REMOVE This Drawer= from your own clones of this template if
  it is bothering you... This drawer is used for HAP Modular Emacs
  DOC TEMPLATES housekeeping...

  =HOWEVER= you may also use it for the same purpose to keep your existing
  Modular Emacs based org documents in sync with the latest updates of the
  template they were created from...
  
  =If you do wish to do the same... Read On Below...=
  
  - =INTERNAL USE Instructions:= /(END USERS SKIP THIS BULLET)/

    This bullet is not for end users... This is /"Note to Self"/ stuff...

    + [ ] =MASTER TEMPLATE ONLY= *Keep The Above Timestamp Up To Date:*

        DO THIS ALWAYS, JUST AFTER YOU UPDATE THIS TEMPLATE... DON'T FORGET!
        /(i.e., BOILERPLATE content and :README: meta data)/
  
  - =PUBLIC USE Instructions:= /(FOR CLONES OF THIS TEMPLATE)/

    + [ ] =Change this= *:LATEST_UPDATE:* =drawer title:= /(within clones only)/

        Change it to: *:LATEST_TEMPLATE_UPDATE:* within NEWLY CREATED CLONES...

    + [ ] *COMPARE the TIMESTAMPS between THIS TEMPLATE and CLONES:*

        The BOILERPLATE content and meta data within CLONES of this
        TEMPLATE will get out of sync after a while due to Harmonic
        Alchemy Modular Emacs version updates etc...
        
        Use the ABOVE timestamp /(within the TEMPLATE and your CLONE)/
        to see if the clone's BOILERPLATE content needs to be updated
        /(brought into sync with its template - MERGE)/ and then perform
        any needed merging/replacing of BOILERPLATE and/or meta data.
        /(e.g, *:README:* drawers, etc.)/

    + [ ] *Keep ABOVE timestamp within CLONES of this template UP TO DATE:*

        =AFTER Completing Above MERGE Step= and your clone's BOILERPLATE
        content has been brought up to date /(i.e. in sync)/ with
        its TEMPLATE... Then update the timestamp ABOVE...
        /(WITHIN YOUR CLONE)/ to record the date of its last sync status...

:READ_ME_FIRST:
=Instructions:= /(How to Install & Use This Template)/

To use *HAP_Simple-Document-Skeleton.org* /(Org-Mode Simple Doc Project /Template)/ for your own projects, perform the following steps: 

/Use the org-mode Checkboxes to Help You Keep Track of Progress/

1) [ ] *Clone a Copy of This File:*

      Put your clone where you normally organize your writing projects.

      *Place it within its own MASTER* *FOLDER* /(or within an existing /project
      MASTER FOLDER that contains other cloned .org Templates allready set up)/

      Existing MASTER FOLDERS contain other files for other projects as well as
      the SETUPFILES and MEDIA required by this Simple Document .org file...

      =Note:= If you put this file within other Project's existing MASTER FOLDERS
            that contain existing ~.org~ files /(cloned from other HAP_Doc-Skeleton/
            /template files)/ Pay CLOSE Attention to the Second and Third bullets
            under Step 3 below to decide the correct action to take during
            those steps...

            =Do NOT OVERWRITE ANY PRE-EXISTING FILES or FOLDERS!!!=

            =OTHERWISE:= If this is a Brand NEW Project, name its NEW MASTER FOLDER
                       to reflect your Simple Document's title...
                       /(i.e., what you renamed this .org file to)/...

      =OTHER Files/Folders May also be placed Within your MASTER FOLDERS...=

2) [ ] =Start Sketching Out Your Document NOW Before You Loose It!=

       =NOTE:= You may be doing this because you have some new idea brewing in
             your mind and you need to write that down before you forget!
             =Right?= Therefore... as soon as you clone this file,
             =STOP= and go immediately to the: ~💡 Scratchpad Refile Binder~ 

      =READ ALL OF THE INFORMATION= UNDER The *☞ Start Here!* heading and
      follow the instructions...

      =write your idea down quickly= /(as per the instructions)/ 
      to get your inspiration recorded before you forget it...  

      Later, After you have all your ideas sketched out and you are 
      ready to be in an ="organized mood"= /(rather than creative mood)/ 
      /This does not imply being organized cannot be a CREATIVE PROCESS/ 
      Then it is time to:

      =Come Back Here And Finish Setting Up This Project...=

3) [ ] =Finish Setting Up The Rest Of This Project LATER= [0/10]

    - [ ] *Change Title of :LATEST_UPDATE: drawer ABOVE:*

         AFTER Cloning, Change *:LATEST_UPDATE:* drawer title ABOVE
         /(within your clone, NOT the Original!)/ to *:LATEST_TEMPLATE_UPDATE:*
         AND Follow Instructions within it...

    - [ ] *Copy/Clone:* ~./media~ /(and contents)/ *to your new project's MASTER FOLDER:*
      
         /(skip this step if this folder already exists within your project)/

         Copy this directory /(into your master folder as a sibling of this file).../ 
         Any external documents or images referenced by your book project should 
         be placed within this ~./media/~ directory...

         There are images within the ~./media/~ directory that are required by
         boilerplate examples within this template... You may inspect/copy etc.,
         these boilerplate examples /(with links to media files)/ to get your
         own images, and external attachments linked and published properly...

         All external links, images, within the boilerplate examples of this
         template may be used as examples for getting your own images, and 
         external attachments linked properly...

         This single ~./media~ directory will serve media and external attachments 
         for this and other Modular Emacs Document TEMPLATE ~.org~ files that may
         exist within this MASTER FOLDER now or in the future...

         /(IF/WHEN THEY /WERE/ARE COPIED HERE)/

         =Note:= You DON'T need to copy the ~./auto/~ directory... That directory
               will be automatically created by *AuxTex* the first time you export
               this ~.org~ file to ~.PDF~...

    - [ ] *Copy/Clone:* ~./org-templates~ /(and contents)/ *to your project's MASTER FOLDER:*

         =WARNING!:= To avoid overwriting existing files, DO NOT COPY this
                   ~./org-templates~ to your MASTER FOLDER IF ONE ALREADY EXISTS!

                   But DO follow the rest of this step so you will know what you
                   should do...

                   =OTHERWISE For MASTER FOLDERS that DO NOT already have one:=
                   *Copy this NEW directory to your simple document's MASTER FOLDER*
                   /(i.e., as a sibling/ /of this book's .org file).../

         =Note:= SETUPFILES Within this new or existing directory are called out
               and included by this ~HAP_Simple-Document-Skeleton.org~ file...
               /(within the file header above)/

         =WARNING:= There may ALREADY be an ~org-templates~ directory existing within
                  your MASTER FOLDER! In that case you will need to merge:
                  ~simple-doc-setup.org~ AND ~default-tags.org~ /(contained within)/
                  into your existing copies of them instead...       

                  =YOU WON'T WANT TO OVERRITE EXISTING FILES= within this 
                  directory you are already using, /(and modified!!!)/
                  but you may need to update existing files you are NOT
                  using currently if/when you DO start using them...

         Other SETUPFILES within this directory are intended to be used by
         other document style project templates and are not needed for this:
         ~HAP Simple Document Skeleton~ Document... You may remove the extra
         files if you wish... 

         =HOWEVER:= If you decide to clone another ~HAP_<book-template>.org~
                  file into this project folder it will pick up its
                  associated SETUPFILES automatically because this folder
                  already exists! Consider this case if/when you decide
                  to delete other UNUSED SETUPFILES... They are small text
                  files not really bothering you...

                  /(YOU MAY NEED THEM LATER DEPENDING ON YOUR CASE)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TITLE:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

         Change to: /"your Simple Document's Project Title"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

        Change to: /"your-Document-Title.pdf"/
        This will be the file name(s) produced during export thence forward
        /(including auto generated files: .tex, etc...)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Copyright © 2022:~ *directive top of this file:*

        Change to: /"Copyright © your info here"/ You are the copyright
        owner of your own documents created from clones of these master
        templates... /(but these MASTER Template Files are to stay under/
        /Harmonic Alchemy Productions copyright. Any Attribution to me/
        /for the template structure of your published docs will be/
        /appreciated... but unnecessary... Thanks! ;-)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+AUTHOR:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

        Change to: /"your NAME"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+EMAIL:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

        Change to: /"your EMAIL"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Created:~ *TIMESTAMP at the top of this file:*

        Put your cursor on the TIMESTAMP: /i.e.,/ <2022-10-05 Wed>
        and type: ~C-c . . RETURN~ The TIMESTAMP will update to NOW.

        =LEAVE THIS DATE ALONE after Setting It The FIRST Time=

        This Date reflects the time/date that you first created this
        new document It should NEVER change after that...

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Last Published:~ *TIMESTAMP at Publish Time:*

        =Don't Change This UNTIL You Have Actually Exported This File=
        /(e.g., as a PDF or HTML, etc. and have PUBLISHED it publically somewhere)/
          
        Until that publishing time comes leave it alone as:
        ~<NOT Published>~
          
        As soon as this is published or re-published, Replace the
        <unpublished> placeholder with a REAL TIMESTAMP by typing:
        ~C-c . . RETURN~ The new Last Published: <TIMESTAMP> will
        appear in place... Do this EVERY time you publish or update
        an existing publishing... /(this will help you keep track)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+FILETAGS:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

        Add your own tags that match the context of your document...

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+DESCRIPTION:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

        Compose /Your Simple Document Description/ as a short paragraph here...
        and then use that to change the directive above...

4) *Purpose of the:* ~./auto/~ *Directory:* /(you do not need to copy this)/

   This is or will-be an auto generated folder where your output ~.PDF~ 
   files are created and placed during LaTeX export. You DO NOT need 
   to copy this folder as it is auto generated during org-mode LaTeX 
   processing...

   LaTeX processing will not delete any prior files contained here... 
   Some of them will be updated, but will have backups...  Any files 
   you place within this folder will NOT be lost, unless you delete 
   them... This folder is a good place to store other temporary files 
   you may be creating, generating.. etc...

5) *Purpose of the:* ~./org-templates~  *Directory:*

   The files in here are automatically linked and included within this
   template. You don't need to change those settings unless you wish to
   customize the already customized tags, and export options.

   /Things are currently set up correctly for the simple document genre,/
   /and the category is all set as well... But you can and may modify/
   /the original files to fit your needs.../

   Other SETUPFILES within this directory are intended to be used by
   other document style project templates and are not needed for this:
   ~HAP_Simple-Document-Skeleton.org~ Document... You may remove the extra
   files if you wish... 

   =HOWEVER:= If you decide to clone another ~HAP_<book-template>.org~
            file into this project folder it will pick up its
            associated SETUPFILES automatically because this folder
            already exists! Consider this case if/when you decide
            to delete other UNUSED SETUPFILES... They are small text
            files not really bothering you...

            /(YOU MAY NEED THEM LATER DEPENDING ON YOUR CASE)/

            =AND= You won't want to OVERRITE existing files within this 
                directory you are already using, /(and modified!!!)/
                but you may need to update existing files you are NOT
                using currently if/when you DO start using them...

   The DEFAULT Tags defined for all project templates are useful for
   most situations and SOME tags are ALWAYS to be defined for this
   LaTeX publishing system to work.

   /Change the SETUPFILE name ABOVE and within this directory from/
   ~default-tags.org~ /to another name and-or replace some -BUT NOT ALL-/
   /of the tags within to your own tags... see instructions inside the/
   /file.../

6) [ ] =Export/Publish to PDF File:=

       The *In-Buffer Settings* specified by the SETUPFILES above will 
       get this file looking good when exported as a Simple PDF file.  
       Once you have your project directory all set up as above you are 
       ready to export your first PDF as a test run...

         *Issue the following Emacs command:*

            ~M-x org-latex-export-to-pdf~

         *OR* If You Enabled *Xah-Fly-Keys* /"Command Mode"/ Try Shortcut:

            ~SPACE e p~

         *OR Export to OTHER Formats:* /(not usefull for this template)/

            ~C-c C-e~

            /(a pop-up will show allowing you to choose export method)/

       After *AucTeX* is done parsing/compiling etc., new files named:

            ~HAP_Simple-Document-Skeleton.pdf~
            -and-
            ~HAP_Simple-Document-Skeleton.tex~ 

       /(or the name you changed it to located at the top of this file)/
       will appear within the same directory as this file... 

       Subsequent repeated calls to the above command will overwrite your
       existing ~.pdf~ -and- ~.tex~ files! /(make backups first if needed!)/ You
       could use the ~./auto/~ directory for backups...

       =If you chose the last option above= LaTeX will output files with other
       extensions for those other output formats...

       =NOTE:= Some SETUPFILES have not been created yet for other eBook formats.
             /(This is a work in progress)/

       =NOTE:= This Simple Document Template is not initially a good
             candidate for other eBook formats, but you possibly may
             use it as a starting point for customizing & creating one...

       =If YOU EXPERIENCE LaTeX ERRORS:= *Consult Buffer:* ~*Org PDF LaTeX Output*~

7) [ ] =Handling Images=

   Some Images may render too large or too small to fit on a page
   of an exported version of this file... This is easy do fix within
   your content on an image by image basis...
      
   Use *LaTeX* and/or *HTML* attributes as follows on the images that need
   to be a different size...

   =Example:=
      
       #+CAPTION: Example larger size .png file 
       #+NAME:  example:00001
       #+attr_html: :width 600px
       #+attr_latex: :width 100px
      [[./media/lavender-banner.png]]



=These Instructions Were Last Modified:= <2023-02-15 Wed>

So far things are pretty basic PDF... There are no plans to add any other eBook formats to this *Simple Document* template... However, I am looking into adding EPUB configurations for *HAP_Fiction-Book* and *HAP_Technical-Book* Skeletons, /(templates)/.

* NEW 💡 Scratchpad Refile:                                        :noexport:
** ☞ Start Here!

This Section is mainly to accommodate "seat-of-pants" writers /(Of Which I Have Been Accused Of... But I Also Crave The Planning Stuff)/. 

I often come here for my [[https://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html]["yak shaving"]] adventures...

Use this: "*💡 Scratchpad Refile*" section as a quick place to document ideas and inspirations as they come along... You can refile them later... 

Even if your quick inspiration was intended for elsewhere?, /(e.g., You become bored documenting tedious technical information when suddenly, out-of-nowhere, an idea for a new sci-fi scene in that screenplay episode you had in the back of your mind all day!, etc.)/

=Ummm.... Parallel Universe?= - =Sure!= You can put anything in here! We've got that covered for you in this Start Here spot. %^)

Use this section to quickly capture inspired at-the-moment ideas...
=While they are still fresh in mind=

=How To Use ???= 

/Simply Come directly here and do what ever you want.../
/"Your Crazy Daze are Covered!" Yay!/ 

=The following Shortcuts= will Help you get started as quickly as possible.
/(using Knowledge Management Best Practices)/

- =NEW IDEA Shortcut:= /Use This For Anything You Want!/

   + [ ] =Copy/Clone:= 💡 <2022-08-20 Sat> *New Example Idea* =Below:=

        =Copy the Heading AND ALL ITS CONTENTS=

        /Change your Clone's Title to Your Own Title/

   + [ ] *Change the timestamp on your Clone Entry:* [0/1]

        =Type:= ~C-c .~ while cursor is sitting on the timestamp

        /i.e., Press: ~Ctrl-c~, let go, and then type a Period/ ~.~

        A date chooser panel will pop up...

      - [ ] *Press* ~ENTER~ *to auto accept today's date and time.*

           The existing timestamp will change to TODAY...

   + [ ] *Advance your cursor and Start Writing!!!*

        Advance your cursor few more lines down to some fresh 
        empty space and Start Typing Your New Idea Like Mad!!! 
        /(Remove the boilerplate content after reading it...)/

   + [ ] *Don't stop Writing!*

          Don't worry about formatting or organizing it until later, 
          after all your inspiration has passed and you are ready 
          to organize...

          However without breaking your focus, you should add relevant
          ~:org_tags:~ that come to mind as you are writing...

          This is easy to do... Simply Type: ~C-c C-q~ Add Your Tag
          and =THEN CONTINUE WRITING...=

          Adding =TAGS= is a =VITAL KM BEST PRACTICE FIRST STEP=
          which will help you find important things you have written
          by the seat-of-your-pants, LATER LONG After you may have
          forgotten!  /(better than Google Search)/ :trollface:

   + [ ] =TODO After You Are Done Writing:=

      - [ ] *Adjust Space:*

           Adjust space between your headings and your 
           fantastic ideas below them it to one single 
           blank line...

      - [ ] *Continue Writing/Developing RIGHT HERE if needed:*

           If you are not yet sure where this NEW IDEA should go
           AND you are still inspired to write... Simply continue
           writing and developing this IDEA in place RIGHT HERE...

           =ONE IMPORTANT Point:= It is Good KM Practice to continue
           adding relevant org-tags to this item right NOW before you
           forget...

           You may not know where things belong in the beginning but
           you most likely DO Know the category, genra, etc. of your
           new idea...

           This will help you in case you forget all about it later...
           Sooner or later It will show up in some random tag search
           that way and remind you...
          
           When that time comes, you may know exactly where it should
           go and the reminder simply jogs your memory to move it into
           the right bin for further processing later as part of a
           scheduled task...
          
           =For NOW=, Don't Worry about what it is for or where to
           put it... It is still here in "dream state" which is
           GOOD... Don't scare away your muses when they beckon! 
           Get your Idea down first, no matter what state it may
           be in... =GET YOUR IDEA DOWN=

      - [ ] *You Are Free To Go Out And Play Elsewhere Little Grasshopper*

           If after writing... You don't feel like organizing 
           now? =NO PROBLEM=... But come back later and organize 
           things... =OK?= Don't create a swamp in here! 
           /And don't forget to take/ /your bath tonight... ;-)/

Having done the simple steps above any time you get inspired, you will much later in life be able to tell your grand children.. /"I got my first spark of an idea for that story back in Year, Month, Day, time, second"/ 50 years later! Now that is being organized! LOL

** NEW 💡 <2020-06-07 Sun> My New Business Idea! /(example)/
:README:
   This is a dummy example of some crazy idea that you may have 
   gotten at the spur of the moment, while you were doing something 
   elsewhere within this project...  After you are done getting as 
   much of the idea as you initally can then you can simply go back 
   to what you were doing before the inspiration segue tore you away... 
   You might want to schedule this as a todo item before leaving though...

   Later when you are free you can come back to file this or place it 
   where it belongs.  In the case of the note below it would probably 
   go in a research folder of a Sci-Fi related project...

        It is only here published in order for the TEMPLATE to show something
        in its body as an exported PDF...

        The structure of this BOILERPLATE is all set up for 
        you allowing you to immediately begin writing it as
        your FIRST Main Topic in your document...

        Rename *Main Topic A:* /(MASTER - etc...)/ to a *Unique Title*
        and remove /(MASTER - etc...)/ in order to commandeer the
        entire item for your needs...

   - [ ] =Change The Anchor Link=

        Change the anchor /(directly under the Main Topic Title)/ to
        match your new Main Topic's title name...
         
        =Note:= I created the following convention for making unique

              The anchor ~PREFIX_~ is there to match the named sections

              across ALL of these HAP_Document-Skeleton.org Template
              files... This will help keep your anchors unique, and
              also add an extra *KM* dimension of *category* to them...

              create anchors elsewhere within ALL of your document

To do that place your cursor at the very beginning of the pasted heading /(completely collapsed)/ and type: ~M-S-<right or left arrow>~  Using the Shift key changes the hierarchy level of the cloned heading as well as the relative sub level headings it may contain... if it is not collapsed first you only change the level of the selected heading but none of the headings below /(no matter if they are currently sub headings)/.

The intent of these templates are to save lots of time starting up a new document or to quickly develop a new idea.  Lets see if it helps. :trollface:

** 📄 Instructions:

=Treat Anything Found Within This Section as a Potential TEMPLATE= which may be used repeatedly as you write your Document Above...

Change the Name, titles, and/or headings of Your Cloned Template to a specific title required within your document...

** 📃 Sub Sub Topic /(sub-sub topic headings for your SUB-TOPICS - rename clones)/
:README:
   Use this space to more headings to the body of SUB-TOPICS... Here is

*** NEW 📄 Heading T /(template with tables - rename this)/

**** Basics:

The following are example Tables you can use /(with some instructions)/ Use what you need and Remove the rest...

- *Simple Basic*

   | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
   |--------+--------+--------+--------|
   |        |        |        |        |

- *A Bit More than Basic*

  | My Column 1 | My Column 2 | Last Column |
  |-------------+-------------+-------------|
  |          42 | foo         | bar         |
  |          23 | baz         | abcdefg     |
  |-------------+-------------+-------------|
  |          65 |             |             |

\newpage

**** Column Allignment:

- *Columns are automatically aligned by default as such:*

   /Number-rich Columns to the Right/

   /String-rich Columns to the Left/

- *Override Automatic Alignment:*

   /If you want to override the automatic alignment 
   use:/ ~<r>~, ~<c>~ or ~<l>~.

   #+CAPTION: Table with aligned columns
   |              |     <c>      | <l>          |
   | 1            |      2       | 3            |
   | Right        |    Center    | Left         |
   | xxxxxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxxxxx |

\newpage

**** Header row

- *You can create tables with a header row:* 

   /(by using a horizontal line of dashes to separate/ 
    /it from the rest of the table)/ 

   *Like This:*

   #+CAPTION: Table with an header row
   | Name of column 1 | Name of column 2 | Name of column 3 |
   |------------------+------------------+------------------|
   | Top left         | Top middle       |                  |
   |                  |                  | Right            |
   | Bottom left      | Bottom middle    |                  |

\newpage

**** Table placement

- *Align Table Centred:* 
   /(the default)/

   | a | b | c |
   |---+---+---|
   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   | 4 | 5 | 6 |

- *Do NOT Align Center:*
   /(overrides default)/

   #+ATTR_LATEX: :center nil
   | a | b |
   | 1 | 2 |

- *Align Table to Left Side:*

   #+LATEX: \noindent
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :center nil
   | a | b | c |
   |---+---+---|
   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   #+LATEX: \hfill

   /The noindent just gets rid of the indentation of the first line of a paragraph which in this case is the table. The hfill adds infinite stretch after the table, so it pushes the table to the left./

- *Align Table to Right Side:*

   #+LATEX: \hfill
   #+ATTR_LATEX: :center nil
   | a | b | c |
   |---+---+---|
   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   | 4 | 5 | 6 |

   /Here the hfill adds infinite stretch before the table, so it pushes the table to the right./

- *Table size:*

   #+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
   | Cell in column 1, row 1 | Cell in column 2, row 1 |
   | Cell in column 1, row 2 | Cell in column 2, row 2 |

   *NOTE:* /You can do a whole lot more with org-tables /using/
         /table.el but that information is too much to include/ 
         /in this template.../ 

         /Consult your Org-Mode cheat sheet instead/
