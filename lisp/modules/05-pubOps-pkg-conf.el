;;
;; This module adds extra tools for writing, viewing, and publishing to give you
;; a jump start at using Emacs as a great publishing platform.  Just as good or
;; in-my-opinion, better than using something like Open Office, MS Word, or even
;; something fancier like Scrivener!
;;
;; using vmd-mode in combination with olivetti, etc. provide you with both
;; WYSIWYG live (like standard word processors) but also very powerful macro
;; commands, ease of fast typing everything (no mouse needed) etc.  Which is
;; why I strongly feel Emacs is the best publishing tool out there for anything!

;;
;; Change Log: (descending chronological order)
;;

;; 2023-002-10 - Alisha Awen, HarmonicAlchemy@proton.me
;;   Removed DEFT I am NOT using it and it is a PAIN in the ASS!
;;   Sorry about that Jason Blevins... You did a lot great of work
;;   and contributed to Emacs but this thing drives me nuts!
;;   Also, DUDE!... Please Update Your Code... the cl (old common lisp lib)
;;   is depreciated! I am tired of seeing that in my startup logs...
;;
;; 2022-009-27 - Alisha Awen, HarmonicAlchemy@proton.me
;;   Changed Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs TO: v3.5...
;;   No Longer Using mmd-mode (IMHO it is not worth the effort)...
;;   Removed VMD-MODE completely. (VMD has critical security problem)
;;   I removed ALL NODE JS from my machines and removed its requirement
;;   from HAP Modular Emacs as well...  No more HODE JS Period...
;;   The Only Reason NODE was installed was for VMD actually.  Not
;;   developing JS apps so NODE and all the FLUF it comes with is NOT
;;   needed here...  (if you do JS Dev and need it you probably already
;;   have it)
;;
;;   Also commented out Pandoc Code to see if that may have been
;;   causing any problems... IF it is, it may ALSO be removed completely
;;   later... Pandoc as an external tool works great...
;;   Not sure if Emacs configuration with pandoc works well at this point...
;;   MORE RESEARCH NEEDED...

;; Declare a list of required packages for writers, bloggers, publishers, etc.:
;; NOTE: Currently NOT using markdown mode or any of its features... I use external app
;; to view markdown... And I DON'T use it directly... I use ORG mode for EVERYTHING now...
;; Fountain is considered a variant of markdown... I do USE that... Org Mode supports it
;; in source code blocks... Getting Fountain script to LaTeX is still an ongoing research task...
